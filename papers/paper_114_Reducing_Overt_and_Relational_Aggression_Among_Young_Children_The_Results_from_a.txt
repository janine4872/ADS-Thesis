ABSTRACT. This paper presents the results of an independent two-
year evaluation of the I Can Problem Solve (ICPS) universal prevention
program, implemented in kindergarten and first grade classrooms in a
racially and ethnically diverse urban school district. Matched pairs of
schools were assigned to Instruction (i.e., treatment) or Control status.
Teachers assessed students’ behaviors at pre and post implementation
using two different rating scales. Overall, we found support for the effec-
tiveness of ICPS in increasing prosocial behaviors and in reducing ag-
gressive behaviors. The mean change scores of both scales showed a
significant additive effect, with children (n = 96) receiving two years of
ICPS instruction showing greater improvement than both children re-
ceiving one year of ICPS instruction (n = 106) as well as the two-year
Control students (n = 24). The authors were selected by the school dis-
trict to evaluate ICPS, and are not affiliated with the program.

KEYWORDS. Universal prevention, overt aggression, relational ag-
gression, children, prosocial behavior
Longitudinal research (Eron, 1997; Huesmann, Eron, Lefkowitz, &
Walder, 1984; Lahey, Loeber, Burke & Applegate, 2005; Olweus,
1979, 1993) suggests that aggressive behavior is learned early and
learned well. In fact, it is one of the most stable characteristics over
time, with aggressive behavior at age six predicting violent behavior
twenty and more years later (Huesmann et al., 1984). Eron (1997) sug-
gests that the window of opportunity to intervene to prevent the devel-
opment of antisocial attitudes and behavior patterns may in fact be very
small (i.e., between ages six to eight). Furthermore, researchers have
consistently noted that regardless of how it is measured (e.g., teacher
ratings, peer assessments, or behavioral observations), aggressive be-
havior is very stable from childhood through adolescence (Rubin,
Bream & Rose-Krasnor, 1991). Given these findings, universal preven-
tion programs designed to intervene early in young lives are an essential
component to any long-term efforts to reduce the incidence of aggres-
sive behavior.
In the present study, the Interpersonal Cognitive Problem Solving
curriculum (also known as I Can Problem Solve) (ICPS; Shure, 2001)
was implemented, with the goal of increasing prosocial behavior and re-
ducing aggressive behavior in children in kindergarten and first grades
in a large, ethnically diverse urban school district. ICPS is a school-
based universal/primary prevention program that focuses on children’s
cognitive processes and problem-solving skills rather than on specific
behaviors. Three prior quasi-experimental evaluations by the ICPS pro-
gram developer have produced positive, significant findings, although
some of the studies experienced subject attrition. In a two-year study of
ICPS with four- and five-year olds, Shure and Spivack (1982, 1980)
found that participating children were less impulsive, had less inhibited
classroom behavior, and exhibited better problem-solving skills. Chil-
dren were assigned to one of four instruction conditions (i.e., two years
of ICPS; ICPS in nursery school only; ICPS in kindergarten only; or
no-instruction control). Sample sizes within the conditions ranged from
27 to 39 per group.
A five-year longitudinal study (n = 252) revealed that ICPS children
had better classroom behavior and problem-solving skills, with the
greatest impact on boys trained by their teachers, and girls trained by
their mothers (Shure, 1993.) Finally, a study of ICPS implementation
28 JOURNAL OF SCHOOL VIOLENCE
with African American mother-child pairs (n = 40) found that ICPS
children whose mothers best learned how to apply the problem solving
techniques when actual problems arose, showed the most behavioral
improvement. This finding was especially true among youngsters who
most improved in their ability to offer alternative solutions to problems
(Shure, 1983).
The purpose of the present study was to experimentally evaluate the
effectiveness of ICPS in an urban school district. Specifically, we hy-
pothesized that children receiving instruction in ICPS would demon-
strate more pro-social behavior and less aggression than children who
did not receive ICPS training. Furthermore, we were interested in exam-
ining whether there were incremental benefits in receiving an additional
year of ICPS training.
This study makes two contributions to the literature. First, while prior
evaluations of ICPS have shown effects for children in problem solving
skills, prosocial behavior, and impulsive behaviors, the present study is
the first to examine distinct aspects of aggression, specifically relational
and overt aggression. Secondly, this study provides a recent, independ-
ent assessment of the program’s effectiveness. Most other evaluations
of ICPS were conducted over a decade ago by one of the program’s de-
velopers. This is important given the increasing emphasis placed on evi-
denced-based practices as mandated by the No Child Left Behind Act
(2001) (Daunic, Smith, Brank et al., 2006).
THE ICPS THEORETICAL BASIS AND CURRICULUM
The ICPS curriculum developed from earlier work (e.g., Spivack,
Platt & Shure, 1976; Spivack and Shure, 1982), in which the authors
(including Shure, the developer of the present ICPS program) posit that
an individual’s thought processes and skills are more important than
that person’s belief system in determining how the individual will be-
have. That is, for example, they state that teaching children how to think
rather than what to think is the more important factor in determining
how socially well adjusted the children will be (e.g., less aggressive,
more assertive, less passive). Thus, the ICPS curriculum does not teach
children specific solutions to particular situations or problems. Rather,
it focuses on the cognitive processes and skills needed to solve prob-
lems generally with the assumption being that children will generate
better solutions with improved problem-solving skills.
Douglas Boyle and Connie Hassett-Walker 29
The ICPS curriculum for kindergarten and the primary grades
(Shure, 2001) consists of 83 lessons that include a stated purpose of the
lesson; a list of suggested materials; and a teacher script, which explains
the basic steps in conducting the lessons. ICPS is optimally taught three
to five times per week. Lessons focus on training children to: generate a
variety of solutions to interpersonal problems; think through the conse-
quences of each potential solution; and identify thoughts, feelings, and
motives that can generate problem situations. A key principle is that the
child, rather than the teacher, must solve the problem at hand (e.g., a
peer cut in front of the child in line; a classmate is using something–the
computer, for instance–that the child wants). This will help the child de-
velop the habit of creating solutions to problems, considering conse-
quences for his/her actions, and thinking for her/himself. The program
includes formal lessons as well as specific suggestions for integrating
what is taught into the day-to-day classroom happenings, a technique
called ICPS dialoguing (Shure, 2001).
Initial lessons teach children word concepts (e.g., some/all, if . . .
then) and pre-problem-solving skills, which provide building blocks for
recognizing others’ feelings, and for the applied problem-solving les-
sons that come later. Subsequent lessons help children to identify their
own and others’ feelings. Final lessons use role-playing games and
dialoguing to promote problem-solving skills. Teachers can follow the
ICPS lessons as they are described in the instruction manual, as well as
infuse the concepts into regular curricular subjects (e.g., reading, math,
social studies), and apply the ICPS dialoguing technique to solve prob-
lems that may arise throughout the school day.
Teacher Training
During both project years, instruction staff received a copy of the
ICPS Teacher’s Manual prior to the kick-off training, which was held
mid-winter (i.e., December/January). Each year, a subsequent ‘booster’
training was held several months later, focusing on the ICPS dialoguing
technique. Teachers’ specific issues with implementing ICPS in their
classrooms were addressed at the follow-up training (e.g., finding the
time to teach the lessons despite their other academic requirements; en-
suring that the teachers were making sufficient progress so that they
would reach the later problem-solving lessons).
30 JOURNAL OF SCHOOL VIOLENCE
Implementation Fidelity
An evaluation staff member made pre-scheduled visits to ICPS class-
rooms to observe each teacher’s ICPS lessons and/or dialoguing with
students. Two observational visits were scheduled for each Instruction
classroom. The first visits occurred in March, and the follow-up visits
occurred in June of the spring semester. Thus, the observations oc-
curred before and after a follow-up training focusing on the program’s
dialoguing technique. The evaluator observed which lesson the teacher
was teaching, whether or not any dialoguing occurred when a problem
arose during or after a lesson, if the teacher incorporated additional in-
structional techniques (e.g., using stories, role-playing), if ICPS was in-
fused into other curricular subjects, and whether ICPS materials (e.g.,
word posters) were visibly displayed around the classroom. In addition,
the evaluator asked teachers how many times each week, on average,
they taught ICPS lessons, and for how many minutes.
Teachers’ enthusiasm for the ICPS curriculum varied, which im-
pacted how frequently, and how well, they taught it to students. Several
teachers had great enthusiasm for the ICPS lessons. Most of the other
teachers did an adequate to very good job of instructing their students.
In addition, many of the teachers indicated that they found the ICPS
concepts useful for maintaining classroom order.
STUDY METHODS
Setting and Procedure
The present evaluation was conducted in an urban school district (the
District) with a predominantly Hispanic population. The District has
one of the lowest per capita incomes in the State, with nearly a quarter of
the city’s children living in poverty. A survey administered to the Dis-
trict’s middle school youth (n = 501) in 2000 found high instances of
physical fighting, gang membership, and weapon-carrying among the
seventh and eighth graders. In response to these survey findings, the
District decided to implement the ICPS universal prevention program,
and contracted with a University-based research institute1 to conduct an
independent evaluation of the program.
The District began implementing ICPS in kindergarten classes in
randomly selected schools during year one of the project. Implementa-
tion continued during year two, when the student cohort was in the first

grade. ICPS instruction took place an average of twice per week, over a
period of four months, in participating kindergarten and first grade
classrooms during project years one and two, respectively. With sup-
port from school administrators, ICPS was incorporated as part of
teachers’ lesson plans.
Participants
Schools were matched according to the number of students and kin-
dergarten classrooms; racial and ethnic student body composition;
socio-economic status (as measured by the percentage of students re-
ceiving free or reduced-price lunch); and language proficiency of stu-
dents. Schools were then randomly assigned to Instruction or Control
status. Despite initial agreement by the school principals to participate
regardless of experimental status, two schools objected to being as-
signed to the Control group, and refused to participate further. This left
us with more Instruction than Control schools.
The student sample (n = 226) at the end of the second project year, for
which pre and post implementation behavior ratings were received, con-
sisted of the following experimental groups: students in the Instruction
group (n = 96) for two consecutive years; students receiving one-year
only of ICPS Instruction (n = 106), either in kindergarten or first grade;
and students in the Control group (n = 24) for two consecutive years.
There are slightly more students in the One-Year Instruction group than
Two-Year Instruction group, mainly because the District’s project coor-
dinator enrolled a new batch of first graders during the second project
year. Some of these students had not been in the District during the first
project year; or had been in Control kindergarten classrooms.
As seen in Table 1, ethnically over 80 percent of participants in each
group were Hispanic. Racially, African American students made up
nine and five percent of the Two- and One-Year Instruction groups, re-
spectively. No Control group participants were African American.
Small percentages of participants in each experimental group were
White (i.e., eight percent of the Control group; and five percent each of
the Two- and One-Year Instruction groups).
Over 91 percent of participants in each experimental group received
free- or reduced-price lunch, an indicator of lower socio-economic sta-
tus. Each experimental group contained more females (53 to 58 percent)
than males (42 to 47 percent). Chi-square analyses revealed no signifi-
cant differences between the various experimental groups by race/eth-
nicity, socio-economic status, or gender.

Measures
Teachers rated students’ behavior at two times in both Instruction
and Control schools, corresponding to the period before and after ICPS
implementation in the Instruction schools. Two behavior rating scales
were employed: the Preschool Social Behavior Scale (PSBS; Crick,
Casas & Mosher, 1997); and the Hahnemann Behavior Rating Scale
(HBRS; Shure, 2002).
The Preschool Social Behavior Scale (PSBS; Crick et al.,1997) is a
16-item Likert-type behavior rating scale that measures relational and
overt aggression, as well as prosocial behavior. Teachers were asked to
rate student behavior on a scale ranging from 1 (not at all true) to 9 (ex-
tremely true). 2 We recoded the items so that higher ratings on the total
PSBS reflect more socially appropriate behaviors (e.g., less aggressive
behavior). We also created subscales for prosocial behavior (e.g., is
good at sharing and taking turns; is helpful to peers); as well as rela-
tional aggression (e.g., when mad at a peer, this child keeps that peer
from being in the play group); and overt aggression (e.g., pushes or
shoves other children; verbally threatens to hit or beat up other chil-
dren). These were generated using the subscales originally created by
Crick and colleagues (1997), and consisted of the following numbers of
items: four (prosocial), six (overt aggression) and six (relational aggres-
sion). For our sample, alpha for the total PSBS was .93 (pre-test) and .92
(post-test). In addition, each of the three subscales had alpha > .90 at
both pre- and post-test.
The Hahnemann Behavior Rating Scale (HBRS; Shure, 2002) is an
11-item nine-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (not at all true) to
Douglas Boyle and Connie Hassett-Walker 33
TABLE 1. Sample Demographics
9 (extremely true). Teachers were instructed to rate each student’s be-
havior on aggression, impulsivity, passivity, and prosocial behavior.
We also created subscales for aggression/impulsivity (e.g., is physically
aggressive: hits, pushes or in other ways hurts children; displays poor
emotional control: is easily angered or upset, overreacts to stress); pas-
sivity (e.g., is overly inhibited: child withdraws, is overly timid or shy;
is overcompliant: gives in or gives up too easily with peers and/or
adults); and prosocial behavior (e.g., is liked by others; is actively and
effectively engaged in learning). These subscales were generated using
a principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation. We de-
cided that three factors best represented the factor structure of the
HBRS. All items loaded > .65 on their given factors, and there were no
significant cross-loadings. All Eigenvalues were > 1.0. Alpha for the to-
tal HBRS was .78 (pre-test), and .80 (post-test). The alphas for the three
HBRS subscales were as follows: (1) four-item aggression/impulsivity =
.78 pre-test, .68 post-test; (2) two-item passivity = .64 pre- and post-test;
and (3) four-item prosocial behavior > .86 at both pre- and post-test.
RESULTS
Initially, we were interested in examining the pattern of inter-correla-
tions of the two overall measures, and of their various subscales. As
seen in Table 2, the two instruments appeared to be measuring very sim-
ilar constructs, as reflected by the strong correlations between the scales
(r = .77, pretest; and r = .73, posttest; p = .000).
While all the items were recoded to the positive direction to derive
the PSBS and HBRS total scale scores (i.e., higher scores mean more
positive behavior), the individual subscales were summed in their origi-
nal direction (e.g., higher scores on aggression subscales reflect more
aggressive behavior; higher scores on the passivity subscale reflect
more passive behavior). Correlations were in the expected direction,
with significant positive relationships between those subscales measur-
ing similar constructs, and negative relationships for those measuring
conflicting constructs.
Thus, on the one hand, the correlations of the PSBS Overt Aggres-
sion subscale and the HBRS Aggression/Impulsivity subscale were r =
.81 (p = .001) at both pre- and post-test. Similarly, the correlations be-
tween the Prosocial Behavior subscales of the PSBS and HBRS were r =
.86 (p = .001) at both pre- and post-test. On the other hand, measures of
34 JOURNAL OF SCHOOL VIOLENCE
prosocial behavior were negatively correlated with the subscales mea-
suring aggressive behavior.
Group Comparisons on the Total Scales
Given the high intercorrelation of the two dependent measures (i.e.,
the total PSBS and HBRS scales, which ranged from .73 to .77 at pre-
and post-test), multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was
appropriate as an initial test. The results show that the overall
MANCOVA was significant (Wilks Lambda = .91, p < .001). There-
fore, we proceeded to examine differences among the Instruction and
Control groups on the overall PSBS and HBRS. Mean pre- and post-test
scores by Instruction status for the overall scales are shown in Table 3.
We conducted analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) tests to compare
the Two-Year Instruction group with both the One-Year Instruction
group and the Control group. The ANCOVA, shown in Table 4, was
employed to examine whether students receiving ICPS instruction
showed greater improvements in behavior (e.g., less aggression, more
prosocial behavior) relative to Control group students after accounting
Douglas Boyle and Connie Hassett-Walker 35
TABLE 2. Post-test (and Pre-test a ) Scale Correlations
for their mean pretest scores on the PSBS and the HBRS (i.e., mean pre-
test score was used as a covariate in each ANCOVA). Analyses were
performed using the SPSS General Linear Model univariate statistic,
with Model Type III to address the issue of different sample sizes
among the experimental conditions (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2001).
The ANCOVA results reveal that Instruction students showed
greater improvement in behavior relative to Control students. The effect
of ICPS instruction on the two scales’ variance was modest, as mea-
sured by the partial eta squared (χ2) scores. Partial eta squared is the
proportion of the effect plus error variance that is attributable to the ef-
fect. As seen in Table 4, the amount of ICPS instruction received ex-
plained around seven percent of the variance in the PSBS post-test score
(controlling for mean pre-test score); and around six percent of the vari-
ance in the HBRS post-test score (controlling for mean pre-test score).
The effect sizes are higher when the One-Year only Instruction students
36 JOURNAL OF SCHOOL VIOLENCE
TABLE 3. Pre- and Post-Test Means and Standard Deviations for PSBS and
HBRS Total and Subscale Scores
are excluded from the ANCOVA, and just the Two-Year Instruction
and Control students are compared.
We followed the overall ANCOVA with post hoc comparisons using
Tukey HSD to examine any differences by amount of instruction re-
ceived (i.e., two versus one year of ICPS instruction). As seen in Table
4, students receiving two years of ICPS instruction exhibited more
prosocial and less aggressive behavior (as measured by the PSBS) than
both Control group students and One-Year Instruction students. In con-
trast, on the HBRS rating, the Instruction groups did not differ from
each other, while both were rated higher (meaning more behavioral im-
provement) than the Control group students.
Group Comparisons on the Subscales
Since the ANCOVA’s for the overall measures were significant, we
next examined the constructs measured by the subscales of the PSBS
Douglas Boyle and Connie Hassett-Walker 37
TABLE 4. ANCOVA Results for the PSBS and HBRS Total and Subscale
Scores
and the HBRS. The subscale means and standard deviations are dis-
played in Table 3.
ANCOVA analyses for the PSBS subscales, shown in Table 4, re-
vealed significant differences in the expected direction (i.e., Instruction
students showed greater behavioral improvement than did Control stu-
dents) on prosocial behavior, as well as on the measures of overt and re-
lational aggression (which are coded in their original direction, with
higher ratings indicating more aggressive behavior). ANCOVA’s for
all the subscales shown in Table 4 were significant, with effect sizes
ranging from three to seven percent of variance in behavior explained
by amount of ICPS instruction received. The effect sizes for the overt
aggression, and prosocial behavior subscales increased to six and nine
percent, respectively, when the One-Year Instruction students were
omitted from the ANCOVA.
Post hoc Tukey analyses of the PSBS subscales revealed that stu-
dents who received two years of ICPS instruction exhibited signifi-
cantly less relational aggression, and more prosocial behavior when
compared to both One-Year Instruction and Control group students. On
the overt aggression subscale, Two-Year Instruction students improved
more than did Control students. However, the One-Year Instruction stu-
dents were not significantly different from either the Two-Year Instruc-
tion or the Control students on the PSBS overt aggression ratings.
Next, we examined the HBRS subscales. As is shown in Table 4, the
groups differed only on the prosocial behavior subscale. The largest effect
(χ2 = .12) was for the HBRS prosocial behavior subscale, with receipt of
ICPS instruction explaining 12 percent of the variance in students’
prosocial behavior. The effect size becomes higher (χ2 = .19) when the
One-Year only ICPS Instruction students are omitted from the ANCOVA.
Tukey post hoc analyses of the HBRS subscales revealed that while
the two Instruction groups did not differ from each other in prosocial be-
havior, both Instruction groups were rated as exhibiting more prosocial
behavior when compared to the Control group. However, in contrast to
the post hoc analyses using the PSBS subscales, none of the groups dif-
fered on either the HBRS aggression/impulsivity or passivity subscales.
DISCUSSION
Overall, we found support for the effectiveness of the ICPS universal
prevention program in increasing prosocial behaviors and in reducing
38 JOURNAL OF SCHOOL VIOLENCE
aggressive behaviors among our group of six to eight year old Instruc-
tion students. Furthermore, depending on the constructs and measure-
ment employed, there is some support for an additive effect of an
additional year of ICPS instruction. That is, on some teacher ratings,
students receiving two years of instruction showed greater improve-
ments than those receiving just a single year of instruction.
The program was relatively more effective in increasing prosocial
behavior, rather than decreasing aggressive behavior. Instruction stu-
dents improved in their prosocial behavior, as confirmed across two
separate subscales. In particular, the HBRS prosocial behavior subscale
showed a 12 percent effect size; which further increased to 19 percent
when just the Two-Year Instruction and Control groups were com-
pared. Reduction in students’ aggressive behaviors was also evident,
particularly in analyses of the PSBS overt and relational aggression
subscales, though the effects were larger for overt aggression than they
were for relational aggression. The finding that ICPS instruction was
more effective in increasing prosocial behavior than in reducing aggres-
sion is likely a reflection of the focus of the program on improving chil-
dren’s problem-solving and interpersonal skills. Though ICPS was not
intended as a violence-prevention program, reduced aggressive behav-
ior may be an additional outcome of improved social skills.
Post hoc analyses confirm a modest additive effect of the program,
with Two-Year Instruction students becoming more prosocial and less
aggressive than One-Year Instruction students. In fact, One-Year In-
struction students exhibited greater behavioral improvements relative to
Control students on only one subscale (i.e., HBRS prosocial behavior).
Furthermore, the One-Year Instruction students did not appear to be-
come significantly less aggressive than the Control students on any of
the aggression subscales. Thus, these findings suggest that to achieve
the desired outcome, when ICPS lessons are conducted only twice
weekly (which is less than the optimal recommendation of three to five
times per week), at least two years of ICPS instruction is optimal.
The different pattern of results between the PSBS and the HBRS
subscales may be explained by at least two factors. First, the constructs
measured by the scales, though related, are nevertheless distinct. Thus,
for example, the PSBS overt aggression subscale is a relatively more fo-
cused measure of aggressive behavior, while the HBRS aggression/
impulsivity subscale (as the name suggests) includes items measuring
behavioral self-control. Secondly, the subscales varied in their reliabil-
ity. All the PSBS subscales had strong statistical reliability, while the
Douglas Boyle and Connie Hassett-Walker 39
reliability of the HBRS aggression/impulsivity and passivity subscales
were marginal.
Limitations. The study experienced attrition, particularly from the
Control group. The Control group likely would have been larger, and
the Instruction and Control samples more equal, had two of the Control
schools not objected to their assignment to Control status and subse-
quently refused to participate in the study. Nevertheless, our analysis of
student demographics found no differences between the experimental
groups by race/ethnicity, socio-economic status, or gender. A reality of
working in a poor, urban school district was that the ICPS implementa-
tion and evaluation competed with many other, more pressing priorities.
Additionally, Control school personnel may have been less motivated to
return parent consents because they were not receiving the ICPS train-
ing. In the future, a better approach would involve offering the Control
schools an incentive, such as an alternative program (e.g., a math im-
provement curriculum) providing benefits unrelated to the ICPS focus.
Had we adopted this approach, the two Control schools that withdrew
from the study may have remained in.
Ideally, we would have liked to have included external rater data as
well, but funding limitations did not permit this. External raters would
have allowed us to have greater confidence that our findings are in fact
the result of ICPS training rather than potential teacher/rater bias. De-
spite this, we believe that the differences in teachers’ ratings of One-
and Two-Year Instruction students lend support to our results. That is,
while it is possible that teachers’ knowledge of whether a child was in
an Instruction or Control school could have biased their rating of a
child’s behavior, this was not the case when we compared the One- and
Two-Year Instruction groups. Instruction classes combined both stu-
dents who had received prior ICPS training, and students who were new
to ICPS. Furthermore, first grade teachers were blind to which students
had received prior training in ICPS during their kindergarten year. This
lends support to the findings that greater improvement for the
Two-Year Instruction students was in fact due to more receipt of ICPS,
rather than teacher/rater bias.
Future Research. The District implemented the ICPS program as a
kind of inoculation for the children while they are still young, to prevent
some of the issues that local youth encounter (e.g., violence) particularly
once they enter the District’s middle school. However, additional re-
search is needed to determine whether the positive behavioral changes
evident during the two-year study period persist during elementary
school and beyond. This question could be the focus of a future longitudi-
40 JOURNAL OF SCHOOL VIOLENCE
nal study. Such an undertaking would require a long-term commitment
by both the District as well as the evaluator to track students, including
those who may leave the District before reaching middle school.
Future initiatives should also involve parents, who can be trained to
reinforce the problem-solving lessons and way of thinking. Many inter-
ventions-including ICPS-have a parent training or outreach component,
although the parent-training aspect of ICPS was not implemented in the
present study due to funding limitations. Implementation across a wider
range of settings (e.g., at school, at home, and in the community) holds a
better chance of reinforcing the positive messages and skills learned,
which can lead to even greater behavioral improvements. Whether the
effect sizes would be larger, and the positive behavioral changes longer
lasting, with the addition of the parent-training component is a question
for future research studies.
Conclusion. The ICPS curriculum offers a relatively low-cost and
easily implemented universal prevention program that in the present
study resulted in significant improvements in children’s behavior. The
effect size results (though relatively modest) are important given the na-
ture of universal prevention programs (i.e., such programs are imple-
mented with a general student population rather than a group of students
who have already been identified as aggressive). Other school districts
dealing with problems of school violence, as well as budgetary con-
straints, might consider devoting more resources to prevention pro-
grams like ICPS when children are younger, rather than relying
exclusively on targeted programs for older children with established
problem behavior patterns.
