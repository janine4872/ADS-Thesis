Abstract
As positive psychology is a nascent area of research, there are very few empirical studies assessing the impact and sustained effects of positive psychology school interventions. The current study presents a 2-year longitudinal evaluation of the effects of a school-based positive psychology program on students' subjective well-being, school engagement, and academic achievements. The study investigated the effectiveness of the Maytiv school program using a positive psychology-based classroom-level intervention with 2517 seventh- to ninth-grade students in 70 classrooms, from six schools in the center of Israel. The classes were randomly assigned to intervention and control conditions, which were comparable in terms of students' age, gender, and socio-economic status. Hierarchical linear regression analyses revealed positive intervention effects on positive emotions, peer relations, emotional engagement in school, cognitive engagement, and grade point average scores (Cohen's ds 0.16–0.71). In the control group, there were significant decreases in positive emotions and cognitive engagement, and no significant changes in peer relations, emotional engagement or school achievements. These findings demonstrate the significant socio-emotional and academic benefits of incorporating components of positive psychology into school curricula.

1. Introduction
Positive psychology is a branch of research within the field of psychology that studies the conditions and experiences involved in human flourishing (Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000). It emerged in 1997 and has gained popularity and shown exponential growth in the realms of research, practice, and influence on individuals despite its brief existence. In the educational sphere, this interest has evolved into the domain of “Positive Education”—a growing area of inquiry in educational research that seeks to integrate positive psychology elements with educational practices to promote subjective well-being (SWB) and improve the mental health of school children (Seligman, Ernst, Gillham, Reivich, & Linkins, 2009). However, claims regarding the benefits of positive education exceed the existing evidence on the effectiveness of such programs (Seligman, Steen, Park, & Peterson, 2005), and critics have emphasized the need for more rigorous research and stronger empirical evidence of the feasibility and effectiveness of positive psychology school-based interventions (Kristjánsson, 2012). In addition, existing school-based programs such as character education and social emotional learning (SEL) share the goal of enhancing schoolchildren's well-being (Elias et al., 1997), thus leading to the question of how positive psychology differs from these foundational approaches and whether positive psychology education programs have an added value in the educational sphere.
The current study sought to address several of these primary questions and to further the area of positive education by conducting a large-scale, randomized-controlled trial of a positive psychology school-based program (The Maytiv Program1). This article reports on the program's longitudinal effects on SWB indices (life satisfaction, positive and negative emotions, and peer relations), school engagement (emotional, cognitive, and behavioral engagement, and school attendance), and school achievement (grade point average [GPA] scores), in seventh-, eighth-, and ninth-grade students in 70 classrooms from six middle schools in Israel.
The Maytiv program (the Hebrew term for “Doing Good”) was developed in an institution of higher education in Israel by a team of psychologists, was approved by the Israeli Ministry of Education, and has served over 5000 teachers and 50,000 children and adolescents in the Israeli educational system.
1.1. The PERMA model: subjective well-being in school
The positive psychology movement in the late 1990s developed from the desire to systematically study human happiness and as a response to the overwhelming tendency in the mental health field to focus on pathology rather than on health (King, 2003). Concepts such as SWB and happiness became a primary focus of research at that time, and a wealth of meaningful research investigating factors that contribute to people's optimal functioning ensued (Seligman, Parks, & Steen, 2004).
The notion of SWB has been frequently operationalized as the relative presence of positive emotions, the absence of negative emotions, and satisfaction with life (Myers & Diener, 1995). Unlike the ample research on the SWB of adults, the study of adolescents and children has lagged behind (Huebner, 1997), and only in recent years more specific models for adolescents' well-being have been developed and proposed (e.g., Casas et al., 2014, Lerner et al., 2005, Parker et al., 2015). Out of these, Martin Seligman, a key founder of the positive psychology movement, developed a model that highlights five enabling conditions for well-being in children and adults and demonstrated the model's applicability in school and classroom settings (Seligman, 2011). This model, which formed the theoretical foundation for developing the Maytiv program, is made up of five essential elements that enhance flourishing and long-term well-being: Positive emotions, Engagement, Positive relationships, Meaning, and Achievement that form the acronym “PERMA.”
1.1.1. Positive emotions
The first element of the PERMA model is positive emotions, which refer to hedonic feelings of happiness, such as pleasure, fun, and enjoyment. Fredrickson's (2004) broaden-and-build theory states that positive emotions broaden and build human psychological resources, and enable elevated engagement and new opportunities for learning (Lewis, Huebner, Reschly, & Valois, 2009). There is a growing empirical confirmation for the associations among school students' positive emotions and their school engagement and satisfaction, motivation for learning, and academic efforts (Meyer and Turner, 2006, Pekrun et al., 2002). SEL interventions that deal, among other things, with awareness of positive emotions, have yielded school-related positive attitudes and behaviors (Elias et al., 1997, Graziano et al., 2007). The emotional states of gratitude and appreciation have received considerable attention in the literature, and have been found to contribute to the cultivation of positive affect in classrooms. Studies have revealed that even simple gratitude exercises, instructing students to count blessings or focus on aspects in their lives for which they are grateful, can produce significant improvement in well-being and satisfaction with school experience compared to problem-focused or no treatment control groups (Emmons & McCullough, 2003).
1.1.2. Engagement
The second contributor to well-being within the PERMA model is engagement, which is defined as a sense of full involvement and complete immersion in an activity, or what some recognize as the state of “flow” (Csikszentmihalyi, 1991, Seligman, 2011). In the educational sphere, the term ‘student engagement’ has been used to refer to students' feelings toward schooling, as reflected in their sense of belonging or attachment to school (emotional engagement); the extent they are invested in their learning (cognitive engagement); and their positive conduct and involvement in school (behavioral engagement) (Fredricks, Blumenfeld, & Paris, 2004). Despite the considerable research on the positive outcomes of school engagement, the information regarding factors that facilitate school engagement remains relatively limited (Appleton, Christenson, & Furlong, 2008). However, studies suggest that relevant and meaningful curricula that align with students' interests and goals are likely to promote students' school engagement and intrinsic motivation (Damon, Menon, & Bronk, 2003). Studies have also indicated that the development of schoolchildren's socio-emotional skills has a significant impact on school bonding and adherence to school norms (Elbertson, Brackett, & Weissberg, 2009). Finally, classroom environments that enable experiences of ‘flow’ have been linked to attention, curiosity, interest, and other positive emotional experiences during learning (Krapp, 1999). Students experienced greater flow, motivation, and joy when they felt competent, active, and in control (Schunk, Pintrich, & Meece, 2008), and when they were given the opportunity to exhibit their abilities, for example, in small learning groups (Peterson & Miller, 2004).
1.1.3. Positive relationships
In the PERMA model, positive relationships refer to feeling supported by others, authentically connected to others, and secure in those connections (Seligman, 2011). Previous research has consistently shown that adolescents' sense of connectedness, positive teacher–student relationships, and a sense of belonging are significant contributors to students' school engagement, academic success, resilience, and SWB (Shoshani et al., 2015, Slone and Shoshani, 2008). Furthermore, students who reported feelings of loneliness and alienation from peers were more likely to consistently leave school early and have attendance problems (Hymel, Comfort, Schonert-Reichl, & McDougall, 1996). Studies of SEL interventions provide support for the critical role of adolescents' positive relationships in their SWB and school engagement (Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning,, Graziano et al., 2007, Slone et al., 2013). Additionally, school-based kindness interventions (i.e., recognizing good deeds, kindness counting, kindness meditation) significantly contributed to strengthening positive relationships in the classroom (Boehm & Lyubomirsky, 2009).
1.1.4. Meaning
Meaning, within the context of PERMA, relates to the feeling of having a purpose in life or serving a cause greater than one's self (Steger, Kashdan, & Oishi, 2008). Possessing this sense of meaning has been shown to be associated with life satisfaction, self-realization, and feelings of fulfillment in various domains (Steger et al., 2008). Within the school context, several factors have been identified as contributors to students' sense of meaning, such as (a) being fully engaged in school activities and experiencing moments of flow (Shernoff & Csikszentmihalyi, 2009), (b) having feelings of school belongingness (Lambert et al., 2013), (c) contributing to something larger than the self (e.g., community service, volunteering) (Hart, Donnelly, Youniss, & Atkins, 2007), and (d) utilizing personal character strengths (Shoshani & Slone, 2013). In 2004, a group of positive psychologists identified 24 cross-culturally recognized core character strengths, which are morally valued aspects of personality (Peterson & Seligman, 2004). Later studies found them to be related to a heightened sense of purpose and meaning in life (Peterson, Ruch, Beermann, Park, & Seligman, 2007). Good character has been associated with moral fulfillment and beneficial outcomes among youth such as school success, resilience, kindness, tolerance, and the valuing of diversity, open-mindedness, and altruism (Shoshani and Aviv, 2012, Shoshani and Slone, 2016).
1.1.5. Achievement
The element of achievement in the PERMA model refers to a persistent drive to master or accomplish personal goals (Seligman, 2011). Extant research on the PERMA model indicates that striving for achievement relates to SWB (Coffey et al., 2014, Seligman, 2011), and conversely, the actual accomplishments do not always lead to higher SWB (e.g., Grant & Dweck, 2003). Furthermore, perseverance and passion for long-term goals have predicted educational attainment beyond that of IQ (Duckworth, Peterson, Matthews, & Kelly, 2007). This ability to put forth effort toward challenges while maintaining interest over time, despite failure and adversity, has been positively related to students' GPA and life satisfaction (Duckworth and Quinn, 2009, Peterson et al., 2007). Likewise, adaptive skills, such as high self-control and low procrastination, have been associated with high self-reported grades and SWB (Howell, 2009). Similar relationships have been reflected in studies assessing emotion regulation and SEL programs that equip middle-school students with a repertoire of personal and academic self-regulation strategies. Participation in such programs has been significantly related to improvements in academic success and GPA scores, even after considering other cognitive factors (Graziano et al., 2007, Gumora and Arsenio, 2002, Payton et al., 2008).
1.2. Variables associated with subjective well-being outcomes
The positive psychology literature indicates that there are significant associations among gender, age, and socioeconomic status (SES) and SWB (for a review, see Watson, 2000). However, most research in this area deals with adults, and very few studies provide information on the associations between these demographic characteristics and SWB in adolescents. For instance, some studies have shown that adolescent girls show greater responsiveness and positive emotions to positive interpersonal events, and may be more likely to experience and express gratitude than boys (Froh, Yurkewicz, & Kashdan, 2009). Huurre, Aro, and Rahkonen (2003) examined the impact of SES on high-school adolescents and found associations between parental low SES and low self-esteem in both genders, and distress symptoms among girls. Conversely, there is also a growing body of literature revealing that as early as seventh-grade, affluent adolescents are experiencing alarmingly elevated rates of depression, anxiety, and substance abuse, supporting the notion that the need for school-based support programs is widespread (Luthar & Becker, 2002). Students' age and grade level may also be a potential moderator for maladjustment, as reflected in various studies indicating a trend of decline in school engagement, academic competence, and SWB during middle-school years (Lepper et al., 2005, Natvig et al., 2003).
1.3. The Maytiv program
1.3.1. Program goals
The Maytiv positive psychology-based program aims to increase students' sense of joy and satisfaction, engagement, meaning, social support, achievement, and overall psychological well-being, by translating the positive psychology approach into tangible tools and skills that can be integrated into their daily lives. In some respects, the Maytiv program is similar to other school-based interventions in that it promotes socio-emotional competencies and creates engaging and supportive school systems. Like emotion regulation training, it addresses topics such as awareness of emotional states and development of the capacity to monitor and regulate positive and negative emotions (Graziano et al., 2007). The Maytiv program also promotes the cultivation of social and emotional skills, fosters positive interpersonal relationships, and supports acts of empathy, similar to SEL programs (Elias et al., 1997). The program emphasizes identifying and enhancing core character strengths and imparts universal virtues to students, as is done in character development programs (Lickona, 1991). However, the Maytiv program also seeks to deepen and broaden students' skills, experiences, and knowledge on additional components that have not received much attention in other SEL programs, and may be particularly influential on adolescents' SWB. For example, the program concentrates on gratitude (Emmons & McCullough, 2003), compassion (Neff, 2009), flow (Csikszentmihalyi, 1991), mindfulness (Burke, 2010), hope (Marques, Lopez, & Pais-Ribeiro, 2011), perseverance (Duckworth et al., 2007), and character strengths (Peterson & Seligman, 2004). In the convergence of these unique elements, coupled with the aspects of the program that are similar to existing interventions, the Maytiv program has the potential to act as an integrative intervention that functions as a bridge between educational approaches and practices in the field of SWB.
1.3.2. Program core components and delivery
The Maytiv curriculum includes eight primary components that reflect the PERMA model's determinants of well-being (Seligman, 2011). These eight components are translated into practice through stories, exercises, discussions, and activities over 15 intervention sessions as shown in Table 1.

Note. The numbers of the lessons reflect their order during the intervention.
The program involves two parallel, comprehensive positive psychology curricula: one for teachers and one for students. The curriculum for teachers is administered in the form of a teacher development workshop and after each session, the teachers instruct their students using a positive-psychology curriculum with age-appropriate materials and activities. The reliance on teachers to deliver the Maytiv curriculum in their classrooms is grounded in the understanding that teachers are the natural facilitators of change with the greatest potential in the school to influence their students (O'Hara & McNamara, 2001). Both the training for teachers and the curriculum for the students include 15 lessons lasting 90 min each (two academic hours) every two weeks, such that the teacher lesson precedes the lesson they are trained to deliver the following week. Beyond the 15 lessons, teachers also receive two 90-minute introductory sessions to positive psychology at the beginning of the process.
Homeroom teachers receive a textbook that includes all of the curriculum materials and detailed lesson plans for each of the 15 sessions, to support the standardization of the intervention implementation. In addition, teachers receive a USB flash disk with PowerPoint presentations for each lesson and complementary multi-media materials, such as short clips and songs. Ultimately, the aim of the curriculum exceeds rote memorization or even deep understanding of the material; its purpose is to guide attitudes, educate emotions, and inspire action. For this reason, each lesson in the textbook is designed in a five-step method that the teachers adhere to while instructing the lessons:
Step 1: Stories (20–30 min). Stories are used as the springboard for teaching the material in the curriculum. Students are exposed to 2 to 3 stories in each lesson and learn to derive certain lessons and action items from them. The stories are about famous and lesser-known figures; they are taken from the Bible, mythology, famous literary works, psychological experiments, and children's books. They are presented through various media: movies, novels, short stories, excerpts from epic tales, or plays. Additionally, other forms of art such as paintings, photographs, sculptures, and music are used to reinforce and build on the ideas within the stories.
Step 2: Exercises (30–40 min). In each lesson, the students are given 1 to 2 exercises to be completed in pairs, small groups, or together as a class. Based on the notion of learning through imitation, many of the exercises involve acting (for example, playing a character, inventing alternative endings to the stories, and engaging in improvisational theater exercises). They are also exposed to other activities ranging from guided visualization to team-building exercises, cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, mindful meditation, sharing personal story, and drawing.
Step 3: Discussion (10–20 min). After the exercise, or as part of it, students engage in a discussion that revolves around two to four guided questions generated by the teacher and/or students. The questions relate to the story or the accompanying text, and the exercise. The purpose of the discussion is to aid students in better understanding and retaining the information, ultimately making the material “their own.”
Step 4: Writing (10–15 min). In each lesson, students have the opportunity to write about the story, the exercise, or the discussion. The writing exercises include analyzing themselves and the stories or texts, free association through journaling, and reflecting on the relevance of the material to their lives.
Step 5: Action. The final step aims to ‘take the ideas and make them real.’ Taking action is considered an important step in assimilating and internalizing the material. ‘Action’ can take the form of preparing a poster for class, delivering a speech or a workshop about the material (an effective way to learn is to teach), volunteering in school or the wider community, or committing to adopt certain behaviors for a chosen amount of time. Most of the action tasks are completed in the two-week interval between the lessons, except for longer or more complex tasks (such as delivering a speech or volunteering), which may be carried out throughout the entire year.
1.3.3. Teacher training
The training workshop for the teachers commences at the beginning of the academic year. The first month of the program consists of two 90-minute introductory sessions to positive psychology. From the second month of training, the workshop focuses specifically on the content of the 15 student lessons. For example, if a student lesson deals with character strengths, the teachers' training session covers this topic extensively. They learn about related theories and research, hear stories, and participate in experiential activities designed for the teachers. The second half of the session focuses on instruction and methods of transferring the lesson to students. At this stage of the year, the teachers also begin implementing the program in the classroom, such that they participate in a session on a certain topic, assimilate and practice the material throughout the week, and teach the lesson to their students in the following week. The next week, at the subsequent teacher session, they share their experiences with their colleagues and proceed to learn about a new topic and related subject material.
1.3.4. Previous research
The Maytiv program has been assessed empirically in one published study (Shoshani & Steinmetz, 2013). Compared with the present study, it was smaller in scope, in that it examined the differences between one middle school that received the intervention and a control school. The previous study did not include academic indices such as achievement or school performance. It did, however, examine the effects of the program on mental health outcomes and found a reduction of general distress, anxiety, depression, and interpersonal sensitivity symptoms among the adolescents who participated in the intervention. Students also exhibited increased self-efficacy, self-esteem, and optimism. Although the results of this effectiveness trial are encouraging and show the potential of the Maytiv program as an intervention for mental health problems, it was only carried out in one school and did not address other important social and emotional aspects of well-being.
1.3.5. Purpose of the current study
The present study examined the effects of the Maytiv program by comparing students in Maytiv intervention classrooms to students in control classrooms at four different time points: Time 1 (before the start of the program), Time 2 (at the end of the program; 9 months after the program implementation), Time 3 (eight months after the program ended; 17 months from Time 1), and Time 4 (one year post-intervention; 21 months from Time 1). The program was implemented in six different schools, with the intention of deepening our understanding of the program's effectiveness, while taking into account background characteristics (socio-economic status, grade level, age, and gender), and classroom characteristics (size, proportion of low socio-economic status students in the classroom, and the average age of the students in the classroom). We sought to answer four primary research questions. First, what are the effects of the Maytiv program on core aspects of students' SWB? In line with the literature showing positive correlations between positive emotional school experiences and students' SWB (e.g., Pekrun et al., 2002), our first hypothesis was that the participants in the intervention classrooms would exhibit increases in positive emotions, life satisfaction, and peer relations, and a reduction in negative emotions from baseline to the end of the program.
The second research question was, what are the intervention effects on adolescents' academic functioning and motivation, such as GPA, school attendance, and school engagement? In line with previous findings that meaningful curricula that encourage perseverance and passion for long-term goals play a role in improving academic outcomes (Duckworth and Quinn, 2009, Payton et al., 2008), our second hypothesis was that the intervention group would experience increases in school engagement, GPA, and school attendance. However, taking into consideration findings from studies examining the impact of SEL programs on students' grades (Payton et al., 2008), we expected to find small effect sizes for GPA scores. In the control group, we expected to find a decrease in GPA, school engagement, life satisfaction, and positive emotions over time, as previous studies have shown a decline in these measures during middle school years (Lepper et al., 2005).
The third research question was, what are the longitudinal effects of the program on adolescents' well-being and engagement? Based on reviews of other short-term (lasting less than a year) educational interventions that showed a trend of decline in outcome variables over time, we did expect a quadratic trajectory with some decline in the dependent variables by the fourth time point (Greenberg, Domitrovich, & Bumbarger, 2001). The fourth research question dealt with the moderating effects of certain demographic characteristics on the relationship between the intervention and the outcomes measured. Given the few and inconsistent results reported in previous research, this exploratory question investigated the potential moderating effects of gender, age, and SES on the relation between the intervention and the outcome variables.
2. Method
2.1. School selection and context
The study was conducted over two academic years, from 2011 to 2012 (the year in which the program was implemented at schools) and from 2012 to 2013 (the follow-up year). It employed a repeated measure experimental intervention design. Additionally, the study randomized 70 7th to 9th grade classrooms consisting of 2517 middle school students from six demographically similar middle schools, located in a large urban school district in the center of Israel.
To recruit schools, we sent letters during the fall of 2010 to an initial pool of 42 six-year secondary schools from the same geographical area. Exclusion criteria for schools were special education-only schools and ultra-orthodox religious schools. The letter included information about the Maytiv school program and an enrollment form outlining the expectations for involvement and the random assignment of classrooms to the intervention or waiting list control condition. Control classroom teachers and students received Maytiv training after the intervention and the follow-up research was completed.
We randomly selected six public schools from the nine schools that returned the enrollment form. The student population of these schools was well-balanced in terms of gender, and randomization occurred within schools at the classroom level. Pairs of classrooms, which were comparable in terms of students' age, gender, and academic level, were matched within each school. In every pair, one classroom was randomly assigned to the Maytiv intervention (35 classrooms, 1262 students) and the second classroom was assigned to the control condition (35 classrooms, 1255 students).
2.2. Participants
2.2.1. Students
In the 70 participating classrooms there were 2650 students, 133 of whom were excluded from the analyses. Six students were excluded due to lack of parental consent (n = 4, intervention; n = 2, control group), 12 refused to complete the questionnaires (n = 4, intervention; n = 8, control group), 111 withdrew from the study (n = 49, intervention; n = 62, control group), and four left the sample schools during the intervention year (n = 2, both groups). This left a final sample of 2517 students in 70 classrooms. The total sample included 845 7th grade students (n = 427 intervention; n = 418 control), 841 8th grade students (n = 417 intervention; n = 424 control), and 831 9th grade students (n = 418 intervention; n = 413 control). By gender, the final sample consisted of 1266 girls and 1251 boys. The random assignment of classrooms resulted in 637 girls and 625 boys in the intervention group (total n = 1262), and 629 girls and 626 boys in the control group (total n = 1255). The age of the participating students at baseline averaged 13.5 years (M = 13.54, SD = 0.67, range 11.9 to 14.9). The students in the participating schools were predominantly Israeli-born adolescents (98%), most of whom were Jewish (99%), and were relatively homogeneous in terms of SES, with mostly (66%) middle SES, 16% high SES, and 18% low SES.
2.2.2. Teachers
The 70 participating teachers were aged 31 to 58 years (M = 43.3, SD = 12.2), 88% of whom were female with middle to high socio-economic backgrounds, and 74% were married. The teachers had completed 15 to 20 years of schooling (M = 16.54, SD = 2.13). The average period of employment in their current school was 9.41 years (SD = 7.82) and they had an average of 15.83 (SD = 9.57) years of teaching experience. None of the teachers withdrew from the teachers' training workshop. Five teachers withdrew from the study in the third and fourth assessment points, because they did not remain with the same homeroom class into the second year of the study.
2.2.3. Trainers, counselors, and research assistants
Three groups of professionals were involved in the implementation of the program and the evaluation. The teacher training facilitators were two female clinical psychologists (MA degree) with several years of experience in clinical practice and facilitating group dynamics. They both studied positive psychology as part of their academic degree, and continued to deepen their knowledge in the field by reading and participating in seminars. Prior to starting the school intervention, the two facilitators participated in an intensive two-week training seminar led by international experts, researchers, and practitioners in the field of positive education. Six female school counselors (one from each participating school), who were responsible for supporting teachers in their implementation of social and emotional content in their classes, monitored the quality and frequency of the program implementation. They were also available to teachers for consultation regarding potential dilemmas that could arise during implementation. Finally, a team of five research assistants (psychology undergraduate and graduate students), consisting of two males and three females (mean age = 24.6, SD = 0.90), administered the questionnaires to the students and teachers. Research assistants were trained by the principal investigator and were blind to group assignment.
2.3. Measures
2.3.1. Socio-demographic measure
This self-report questionnaire included demographic questions about participants' age, gender, country of birth, religion, family status, SES (determined by a set of income thresholds: very low, low, average, good, very good), and household size.
2.3.2. Measures of subjective well-being
Three measures of subjective well-being were used in this study.
2.3.2.1. Satisfaction with life scale (SWLS; Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin, 1985)
The SWLS was developed to assess overall satisfaction and happiness with life and consists of five items (e.g., “So far I have gotten the important things I want in life”) and employs a seven-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Summed responses yield a life satisfaction total score, ranging from 5 to 35, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of life satisfaction. The normative mean score on the SWLS is 23.5, with a standard deviation of 6.43 (Diener et al., 1985). The SWLS has shown good reliability, and adequate construct, convergent, and discriminant validity (Pavot & Diener, 2008). In this study, the alpha coefficients were 0.90 for Time 1 and .89 for Time 2. Identical alpha coefficients were obtained for Times 3 and 4 (α = 0.91).
2.3.2.2. Positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988)
The PANAS is a standardized measure that was developed to measure positive and negative affectivity. The measure consists of 20 adjectives that describe 10 positive and 10 negative emotions, such as “excited,” “proud,” “upset,” and “scared.” Students rated the extent to which they felt each mood in the previous few weeks, on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (very slightly) to 5 (extremely). Earlier research supports high internal consistency and validity via correlations in the expected directions with similar constructs, such as social activity and mental health measures (Watson et al., 1988). The alpha coefficient for the positive affect subscale at Time 1 was .90. Similar alpha coefficients were obtained for Times 2 and 3 (α = 0.91), and 0.92 for Time 4. The negative affect subscale alpha coefficients for Times 1, 2, 3, and 4 were .92, .86, .85, and .87, respectively.
2.3.2.3. Friends subscale of the school adjustment report (Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group [CPPRG], 2001)
This self-report six-item subscale assessed students' interactions with other students in the school context. Examples of items included in the scale are “I get along well with other students at school this year” and “I do not have many friends at school.” Items were rated on a five-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). In this study, the alpha coefficients for Times 1, 2, 3, and 4 were .86, .85, .82, and .84, respectively.
2.3.3. Measures of school engagement and achievement
Several indicators were used to measure the participants' levels of school engagement and achievement.
2.3.3.1. School engagement survey (National Center for School Engagement [NCSE], 2006)
This measure was developed to provide a multifaceted perspective on students' performance in different domains at school (Fredricks et al., 2004). The behavioral engagement subscale is made up of 7 items that refer to participation and involvement in school activities, adherence to classroom norms, and positive conduct (e.g. “I follow the rules at school”). The cognitive engagement scale consists of 22 items that highlight psychological investment in learning and academic performance (e.g., “I am interested in the work I get to do in my classes”). The emotional engagement scale consists 22 items that assess students' feelings of connectedness and sentiments toward the school, classroom, and teachers (e.g., “I respect most of my teachers”). Each item was evaluated on a Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 5 (yes, fits well). The items within each scale were averaged to yield a scale score ranging from 0 to 5, such that higher numbers indicated more engagement. Teachers were requested to complete a teacher version of the measure, which parallels the students' self-report scale and has the same three-subscale factor structure and items. In previous studies these scales met and exceeded the desired criterion for validity, with significant correlations between the different scales and GPA (r = .345–.369, p < .005), math grades, (r = .40–.48, p < .01), and English grades, (r = .37–.43, p < .05) (NCSE, 2006). In this study, the alpha coefficients for teachers' and students' reports at Times 1, 2, 3, and 4 were .86–.90, for the emotional engagement scale, 0.78–0.87 for the behavioral engagement scale, and 0.87–0.92 for the cognitive engagement scale.
2.3.3.2. School achievement
Students' school achievement was assessed by their GPA scores. The grading scale that is commonly used in the Israeli educational system ranges from 0 to 100: 95–100 (excellent), 85–94 (very good), 75–84 (good), 65–74 (satisfactory), 55–64, (acceptable), 45–54 (barely sufficient), and < 44 (insufficient/failed). Students' GPAs were calculated by summing their course grades on the 0–100 point scale, and dividing by the total number of courses.
2.3.3.3. Attendance
Attendance data were obtained from school records and calculated by dividing the total days attended by the total days in the school year.
2.4. Procedure
The school year in Israel starts in September and ends in June. Data were collected in four waves: September 2011, May 2012, January 2013, and May 2013. After receiving authorization for the study from the Israeli Ministry of Education's ethics committee, the academic ethics committee, and the school principals, the schools also secured written consent from teachers, parents, and the adolescents themselves. To ensure their consent was informed, teachers, parents, and students were provided with information about the research, intervention, and control programs. Teachers and students were told that they would be randomly assigned to participate in a positive psychology program or to a control waiting list condition. Teachers and students had the opportunity to withdraw from the program or the study at any stage during the school year. In order to ensure confidentiality, all participants were assigned IDs and were only re-identified for follow-up purposes. Lastly, provisions for counseling or debriefing were available to any participant who felt s/he had been negatively impacted as a result of involvement in the program or study. None of the children, parents, or teachers sought counseling services from the Maytiv team during or following the program.
Six parents objected to their children's participation in the study, but not in the program. At all points of measurement, the teachers were asked to complete standardized scales regarding their students' school engagement during staff meetings. In addition, research assistants administered the battery of questionnaires to the schoolchildren in the intervention and control classrooms. The students completed questionnaires consisting of a socio-demographic measure, a life satisfaction scale, a positive and negative affect questionnaire, a school engagement questionnaire, and a peer relation scale. Students filled out the questionnaires during regular school hours, in sessions that took on average 35 min. The order of the questionnaires and scales was randomized to reduce any systematic order effect.
2.5. The Maytiv program
In each school that implemented the Maytiv program, a team of 6–10 intervention classroom homeroom teachers who worked with the intervention classes participated in a positive psychology training workshop. The workshop lasted 34 academic hours, and included two 90-minute introductory sessions, and 15 bi-weekly 90-minute lessons from September 2011 to May 2012. The teachers' lessons were held at the end of the school day (afternoon) and took place in quiet rooms in the schools.
Two clinical psychologists trained in positive psychology and group dynamics facilitated the seminars (one facilitator for each group). The teacher lessons provided teachers with an introduction to positive psychology, helped them understand the content, and gave them the tools to apply it to their own lives and to impart the material to their students. The teachers were encouraged to take an active part in the learning process in order to support deeper assimilation of the material. They did this through personal sharing and by carrying out a variety of exercises together. Although difficult to monitor, teachers were requested to refrain from sharing their experiences outside of the training seminars. They were also given a textbook consisting of techniques for teaching the curriculum and implementing the lessons in their homeroom classes. The teachers demonstrated active participation in the seminar by carrying out the exercises in the seminar meetings and completing the “homework” that included various applications of the content in their personal lives. All the teachers who participated in the program expressed their consent and confidence in implementing the lessons in their classrooms and no one refused to participate, even when given the opportunity to do so.
The student program was given during the school day in the students' regular classrooms and followed the same format of 15 two-hour sessions. They were implemented bi-weekly, starting in October and lasting 30 weeks. The program was incorporated into the curriculum and took place during the last two lessons of the day, in a class called “Positive Psychology.”
2.5.1. Implementation fidelity
School counselors were responsible for monitoring the quality and frequency of the program implementation. After each class, the homeroom teachers were asked to fill out a report that was designed to evaluate the extent to which the teachers adhered to the lesson plan. They indicated whether they managed to impart the five basic repeating components in each lesson (e.g., stories, exercises, discussion, writing, and action), using a polar question for each component. In addition, the teachers reported whether they felt they had successfully completed each component, using a Likert scale ranging from 1—not at all to 5—very much. Each report also contained an open section, in which teachers were asked to verbally express how each lesson went and to report the extent to which students participated in the lesson. The reports were submitted to the school counselor for follow-up.
2.6. Control group
The control group was a no-treatment waiting list control group (‘passive control group’). The control classrooms did not have any positive psychology lessons or take part in any other social–emotional curriculum during the time of the intervention. They also did not receive any additional attention, support, or guidance from their teachers. They continued with the regular curriculum for middle schools and had their usual classes (e.g., science, math, language arts, history and art). The control group's involvement in the study was limited to completing questionnaires at the various measurement time points; it was placed on the waiting list for the Maytiv program after the completion of the study.
2.7. Data analysis
We employed multilevel modeling with HLM Version 7 (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002) to explore the long-term intervention effects on students' SWB, engagement, and achievement in the presence of the nested data structures. To find the most useful curve to represent overall growth in the outcome measures, we first calculated different growth curve models (e.g., linear, logistic, exponential, quadratic) using the SPSS V22.0.0 curve estimation. The most suitable model to examine students' trajectories over the two-year study period was a quadratic growth curve model, which aligned with our explicit predictions in the third hypothesis concerning linear and quadratic growth trends and the intervention outcomes.
The final hierarchical models were constructed with the standard bottom-up approach from preliminary analyses with steps in HLM followed in sequence. The initial unconditional growth model included two parameters: an intercept that indicated the base in HLM terminology and a linear term. In the second step of the unconditional model building, we added a quadratic term to determine whether this accounted for further variability in the outcome measures. We used full maximum likelihood estimation to analyze these models. Results from the model comparison tests (see Table 2) suggested that the addition of the quadratic parameter improved the description of model growth for most of the outcome variables, excluding life satisfaction, attendance, and teachers' report of behavioral and cognitive engagement. These exceptions were better fit to the linear function and were analyzed linearly.

Based on intraclass correlation (ICC) analyses, when schools and classrooms were included in the models, the average amount of the total variance explained by school effects across all outcome variables was 2.41%, whereas classroom effects explained 13.2% of the total variance. As school effects were below 5% (Lee, 2000), they were removed from the final models. Subsequent ANCOVA models examined whether candidate covariates were significant and should be retained in the final models, in order to control for their effects or to investigate their potential interactions with the program effects.
Based on these preliminary analyses, the final three-level hierarchical model aimed to characterize the SWB, school engagement, and achievement growth over time of students with various background characteristics (socio-economic status, grade level, age, gender), classroom characteristics (size, proportion of low socio-economic status students in the classroom, and the average age of the students in the classroom), along with the intervention conditions and the interactions between the student and classroom characteristics and intervention type.
At level 1, students' individual non-linear growth trajectories were modeled based on their outcome scores from the four measurement time points (September 2011, May 2012, January 2013, and May 2013). The unconditional growth model, with the linear and quadratic terms, was:
where Ytij, the students' outcome measure at time t, is a function of a linear and quadratic growth curve plus random error etij. When both time and time-squared were in the model, to avoid multicollinearity, we centered the Y intercept at Time 2, and the intercept, π0ij, was interpreted as the average outcome scores at 9 months. The linear component, π1ij, is the growth rate or slope for the student over the two academic years, and the quadratic component, π2ij, is the curvature in each growth trajectory. This model assumes that errors (etij) are independent and normally distributed, with a common variance (Bryk & Raudenbush, 1992). Baseline levels of school functioning (school engagement, GPA, and attendance), and SWB indices (positive emotions, life satisfaction, and peer relations) were added to the above equation as covariate variables.
The level 2 model (conditional model) consisted of separate equations (one for base, one for linear change, and one for quadratic change), examining how the between-subject variables accounted for the growth parameters (e.g., base, linear growth, and quadratic growth) derived in the unconditional model. Gender (girl = 0, boy = 1), SES (0 = at or above the poverty threshold; 1 = below the poverty threshold), and condition (control = 0, intervention = 1), were entered into the model with dummy coding. Grade was centered on the average grade of the students (Grade 8). Student age was centered on the average age of the students. The interactions between the demographic variables and the intervention type were not significant and were not included in the final models. The following equations were used to predict the base (π0ij), linear growth (π1ij), and quadratic growth (π2ij)):
At the classroom level (Level 3), we included the number of students in the classroom (SIZE), the proportion of students from low-income families (LOWINCOM), and the average age of the students in the classroom (AgeCl), to determine the influence of the classroom context on the outcome variables. The classroom-level coefficients indicated whether the between-classroom variables accounted for the growth parameters (e.g., base, linear growth, and quadratic growth). We were also interested in the interactions between the classroom characteristics (Level 3) and intervention type (Level 2) (see Eqs. (2), (4), (6) in the following equations). However, since the interactions were not significant, we did not include them in our final reported findings.
Separate models were analyzed for the outcome variables. Due to multicollinearity (see Fitzmaurice, Laird, & Ware, 2004), we could not center the Y intercept at Time 1 in the quadratic model, in order to test the relations between the student-level and classroom-level characteristics and students' outcomes at Time 1 (e.g., September, 2011). Therefore, we created additional linear growth models, Yijk = π0jk + π1jk ∗ (TIMEijk) + eijk, where Y represented the students' outcome measure at a given time point, and the intercept, π0jk, was the student's initial (September 2011) score (i.e., at 0 month). The level 2 and 3 models incorporated student level and classroom level predictors of π0jk (student's initial status at Time 1).
Due to the complexity of the findings resulting from the quadratic trends in the data, we calculated a more traditional effect size (Cohen's d) on the observed data (Cohen, 1988) using the formula d = (M1 − M2) / pooled standard deviation; this highlighted the differences between the students within groups and between groups throughout the measurement time points. Based on recommendations by Hedges and Hedberg (2007) effect sizes were interpreted according to prior relevant research that provided some indication of the effect sizes for different types of outcomes. Educational researchers have indicated that effect sizes around 0.20 for measures of academic achievement, social behavior, and emotional well-being are considered a very significant improvement (Hedges and Hedberg, 2007, Payton et al., 2008).
3. Results
3.1. Preliminary data analyses and descriptive statistics
Preliminary data analyses suggested that all student-level and classroom-level variables were normally distributed with no unusual kurtosis or skewness. In the case of classroom-level data, there were some missing data. In one school, a new principal limited our accessibility to the GPA data at the third and fourth waves of measurement; thus there were missing data for six paired intervention and control classes, and the analyses for GPA were based on 58 classrooms (n = 2208). In addition, six teachers did not continue with their homeroom classes into the second year of the study, and therefore, the follow-up scores of school engagement (T3; T4) were calculated for only 93% of the students (n = 2341).
The SPSS Missing Value Analysis package was used to estimate the pattern of student-level missing data and impute missing values by the appropriate procedures. Except for the GPA and school engagement data loss, there were less than 5% of the data missing across all study variables and waves of measurement; throughout the time points, there were no significant differences in the proportion of missing versus present data in the intervention versus control classrooms. Little's MCAR test (Little & Rubin, 1989) was not significant (chi-square = 454.40, df = 455, p = .49), indicating that the missing data did not show a significant pattern.
The analysis of the fidelity reports showed that the teachers implemented on average 14 of the 15 lessons (M = 14.46, SD = 0.77, n = 35) and 4.6 of the five prescribed components (M = 4.64, SD = 0.82; n = 35). Teachers also expressed feelings of success in implementing each of the program components (M = 4.43, SD = 0.67; n = 35). In the open section, all participating teachers reported excellent cooperation and enthusiastic participation by the students.
Using preliminary analyses, the HLM analysis was also employed to examine whether there were baseline differences in the outcome variables between the intervention and control groups. Based on this model, no significant baseline differences were found between the intervention and control groups. Before employing the HLM models, we examined the means and standard deviations for all outcome variables, separately, for the intervention and control groups at the four time points. The comparisons are presented in Table 3 and revealed an upward trend in the mean levels of many SWB outcomes and school engagement variables in the intervention group, with a slight recession in growth rate during the second year of the study; in contrast, the control group exhibited decreases or no changes across variables.

CR = child report; TR = teacher report; numbers of participants were n = 1255 in the control group, and n = 1262 in the intervention group, except for GPA and teachers' evaluations of students' school engagement in the third and fourth measurement points (GPA: n = 1110, intervention; n = 1098, control group; school engagement TR: n = 1203 intervention; n = 1138, control group).
3.2. Predictors of SWB, engagement, and achievement at baseline
We estimated the baseline variance for each dependent variable at three levels: time, student, and classroom. There was a significant variance for all outcome variables at each level, except for between-classroom variance in life satisfaction and school attendance. We calculated the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) to estimate the proportion of variance due to differences among students and classrooms. Student-level ICCs ranged from 0.09 to 0.32. Classroom-level ICCs ranged from 0.03 to 0.17 and were higher for school engagement and achievement (ICCs = 0.11–0.17) than for SWB measures (ICCs = 0.03–0.17). Overall, these ICCs indicated that students who share the same social environment were more similar to one another than students from different classrooms.
Results of the multilevel analyses showed that several factors were associated with the initial differences in SWB, school engagement, and achievement (see Table 4, Table 5). SES and gender accounted for differences in SWB. Students below the poverty level exhibited lower baseline levels of positive emotions (b = − 1.87, p = .02, d = .23), higher levels of negative emotions (b = 1.46, p = .04, d = .15), and lower levels of peer relations (b = − 2.06, p = .001, d = .41). In addition, classrooms with a higher proportion of students from families living below the poverty level showed lower baseline levels of positive emotions (b = − 6.25, p = 0.04) and peer relations (b = − 9.04, p < .001). Finally, compared with girls, boys reported fewer negative emotions (b = − 1.86, p < .001, d = .34), and more positive emotions (b = 0.64, p = .009, d = .14).

Baseline differences in engagement and achievement were related to SES, gender, students' grade level, and age. Students below the poverty level reported lower levels of cognitive engagement in school (b = − 0.21, p = .009, d = .11), and teachers rated them as having lower emotional engagement (b = − 0.16, p = .03, d = .09). In addition, classrooms with a higher proportion of students from families living below the poverty level showed overall lower levels of behavioral (b = − 1.43, p = .02) and cognitive engagement in school (b = − 1.94, p < .001) in students' reports, lower GPA (b = − 13.18, p = .04), and lower cognitive engagement in teachers' reports (b = − 0.64, p = .04). Boys reported lower emotional engagement (b = − 0.07, p = .002, d = .10), behavioral engagement (b = − 0.17, p < .001, d = .22), and cognitive engagement (b = − 0.25, p < .001, d = .32) compared to girls at the beginning of the study. Higher grade level was associated with lower student reports of behavioral engagement (b = − 0.06, p = .007) and cognitive engagement in school (b = − 0.09, p < .001), lower GPA (b = − 3.17, p < .001), and lower school attendance at baseline (b = − 0.20, p = .03). Students' age was negatively associated with their reports of emotional engagement (b = − 0.01, p = .01) and cognitive engagement (b = − 0.01, p = .03). In addition, the mean age of students in the classrooms was negatively related to GPA (b = − 0.90, p = .03) and school attendance (b = − 0.23, p = .04).
3.3. Intervention effects on SWB
The HLM longitudinal analyses for changes in SWB from September 2011 to May 2013 revealed that on average, participation in the Maytiv intervention program was related to an increase in the students' SWB over time, whereas participation in the control group was associated with a decrease or no change in the outcome variables. However, adding the quadratic term tests revealed that students' progress was not linear in most of the models and that there tended to be a slight recession in growth rate (negative quadratic term) in the follow-up year.
Participants in the intervention group exhibited significant increases in positive emotions from the beginning to the end of the study (mean change = 1.80, d = 0.26), with higher score increases per month (b = 0.112, p < .001) compared to the control group, in which we found significant decreases from Time 1 to Time 4 (mean change = − 1.08, d = 0.16). The quadratic trend was negative (b = − 0.021, p < .001), indicating that the rate of monthly growth in positive emotions slightly decelerated during the follow-up year. A similar trend was found for negative emotions, but in the opposite direction—the intervention participants showed an overall decrease in negative emotions from the beginning to the end of the study (mean change = − 2.99, d = 0.40), while the control group experienced increased negative emotions over the two-year period (mean change = 0.54, d = 0.08). However, the linear decrease in negative emotions in the intervention group over the first year of the study (b = − 0.147, p < .001) had a slight deceleration during the follow-up year (b = 0.014, p < .001) (see Table 6). These findings suggest opposite trajectories in the intervention and control groups, reflecting growth in SWB indicators in the intervention group, but declines in these variables among students in the control group.

Analyses of the remaining outcome variables indicated that peer relations were also improved over the intervention period. Students in the intervention group had linear growth trajectories (b = 0.062, p < .001) in peer relations from Time 1 to Time 4 (mean change = 2.35, d = 0.39), with a small deceleration rate in the follow-up year (b = − 0.011, p < .001). The control participants did not show significant changes in peer relations over time. There were no significant differences over time between the intervention and control groups in life satisfaction. In addition, interaction terms were examined to investigate whether the intervention program had uniform effects on students' SWB as a function of the student-level and classroom-level characteristics. The analyses showed that there were no significant interaction effects of student-level and classroom-level characteristics and type of intervention on changes in SWB.
3.4. Intervention effects on engagement and achievement outcomes
The Maytiv intervention was associated with an increase in several aspects of students' school engagement and achievement over time, compared to a decrease or no change in these aspects in the control group. Also here, a slight recession in growth rate (negative quadratic term) was found in the follow-up year (see Table 7, Table 8). There were slight differences between teachers' and students' reports of school engagement, which were moderately correlated with one another (mean r = 0.22, p < .001). Teachers, in general, provided lower estimates of students' emotional and cognitive engagement, and higher estimates of behavioral engagement, when compared with the students' self-reports.

For self-reported cognitive engagement, students in the intervention group had growth trajectories that appeared to be linear (b = 0.019, p < .001), with a small deceleration rate (b = − 0.001, p = .001). The intervention group's steepest growth in cognitive engagement was observed across the first 9 months of the intervention (mean change = 0.27, d = 0.32), and stayed relatively stable during the second follow-up year. However, from Time 1 to Time 4, students in the control group showed a significant decrease in their investment in learning and academic performance (mean change = − 0.27, d = 0.30). Analyses of the students' self-reported emotional engagement scores also showed significant increases from the beginning to the end of the study among the intervention group participants (mean change = 0.47, d = 0.67), but not in the control group. The positive acceleration rate (b = 0.011, p < .001) slightly decelerated over the follow-up year, as reflected in the negative quadratic trend (b = − 0.001, p < .001). Similar trends were also found in the teachers' reports of emotional (b = 0.014, p < .001, mean change = 0.53, d = 0.71) and cognitive engagement growth (b = 0.016, p < .001, mean change = 0.22, d = 0.24) in the intervention group. Teachers' reports revealed a decrease in behavioral engagement, however to a lesser extent in the intervention group (mean change = − 0.17, d = 0.18) compared with the control group (mean change = − 0.37, d = 0.43).
At baseline, students in the intervention group had an average GPA score of 77.79 (SD = 12.58) and did not significantly differ from the control group's GPA mean score (M = 78.33, SD = 11.98). At the end of the second year of study (Time 4), students in the intervention group had a GPA mean score of 81.15 (mean change = 3.36, d = 0.30), in contrast to a non-significant change in GPA among participants in the control group (GPA mean = 77.69, SD = 12.32, mean change = − 0.64, d = 0.05). The GPA score increase per month was 0.13 points higher in the intervention group (b = 0.131, p < .001) compared to the control group. The negative quadratic trend (b = − 0.010, p = .009) indicated non-linear growth in the GPA score with little deceleration in the intervention group from Time 3 to 4. There were no significant differences over time between the intervention and control groups in school attendance (see Table 7), and no significant interaction effects of the demographic characteristics and the intervention condition on changes in school engagement and achievement.
3.5. Demographic characteristics and changes in outcome measures over time
Beyond the intervention effects, several student-level characteristics were significantly related to SWB and school engagement changes over the two academic years (Table 6, Table 7, Table 8). Compared with girls, boys exhibited lower positive emotions, greater negative emotions, lower attendance, and higher increases in self-reported behavioral engagement and cognitive engagement per month. Students' age was positively related to increases in self-reported emotional engagement over time. Grade level was associated with increases in self-reported cognitive engagement and GPA, and decreases in both positive and negative emotions. Students from families living below the poverty level showed increases in positive emotions and peer relations over time. At the classroom level, the average age of the students in the classroom was positively related to increases in self-reports of cognitive engagement and teachers' reports of emotional engagement. Over time, classrooms with a higher proportion of students from low-income families showed an increase in peer relations and self-reported behavioral and cognitive engagement.
4. Discussion
The promotion of schoolchildren's SWB is a goal that is increasingly being recognized as a priority within the educational context (Sin & Lyubomirsky, 2009). This ambition closely aligns with the core essence of positive education (Seligman et al., 2009). The results from the present study provide preliminary support for the value of positive psychology as an organizing framework that has the capacity to enhance students' SWB within the school context.
4.1. The effects of the Maytiv program on SWB, engagement, and achievement
Aligning with our hypotheses, students in the intervention groups exhibited increases in their emotional SWB, peer relations, emotional engagement, cognitive engagement, and GPA scores. In contrast, students in the control group displayed decreases in positive emotions and cognitive engagement, and showed no significant changes in peer relations, emotional engagement, or school achievement. The results also aligned with our expectation that outcome measures from the follow-up year would fit a quadratic trajectory, as was observed with most of the variables. Contrary to our predictions, there were no significant differences over time between the intervention and control groups in life satisfaction or school attendance.
The effect sizes for these outcomes (school engagement: 0.24–0.71; GPA: 0.30; SWB indicators: 0.26–0.40), are comparable to, or exceed, the effect sizes for similar outcome measures reported in several meta-analyses of school based socio-emotional interventions for adolescents (for review see Payton et al., 2008). For example, the mean effect size of student change at the end of the intervention in 180 SEL intervention studies was 0.28 for academic performance, 0.24 for positive social behavior, and 0.23 for emotional distress (Payton et al., 2008).
Moreover, in translating the effect sizes in our study into improvement indicators that demonstrate average percentile gains accomplished by the average student in the intervention group, they ranged from a 7% improvement in GPA scores, to 9–10% gain in SWB indicators and an 8–11% gain in school engagement indicators. Rather than relying solely on effect size, these indices may offer a better representation of the actual value of the changes in achievement (Vacha-Haase & Thompson, 2004).
The positive impact of the Maytiv program on cognitive engagement and school grades, while modest, is particularly noteworthy in light of the persisting pressure on schools to increase students' grades and standardized test scores (No Child Left behind Act of 2001, 2008). However, the small student achievement gains suggest that change in learning abilities may require more complex, focused, and prolonged school reforms to become visible, sustained, and recognizable (Ross et al., 2001).
In contrast to the improved outcomes in the intervention group, adolescents in the control-group classrooms experienced a decline in academic engagement and emotional well-being. This finding corroborates previous research that addresses the complexity of adjustment for adolescents and their decline in academic motivation and emotional engagement throughout middle-school years (Fredricks & Eccles, 2002). However, the students participating in the Maytiv program seem to have experienced a reversal in this general decline, and exhibited increases in emotional and cognitive engagement, academic achievement, and positive emotions. These results indicate that the program contributed to the students' well-being in multiple ways. First, it seems to be somewhat preventative in its nature, as the students participating in the intervention may have been protected from the decline that can occur during early adolescence. Second, it generated gains that exceeded what is generally expected of a prevention program—the students in the program exhibited increases in most positive adjustment indices from baseline to the end of the program and follow-up periods.
Similar trends showing improvement in emotional and cognitive engagement were found in both teacher and student reports, although the correlations between students' and teachers' assessments of student engagement were relatively weak. This finding aligns with previous studies that have found low agreement between teachers' and students' evaluations of students' motivation and competence (Dicke, Lüdtke, Trautwein, Nagy, & Nag, 2012). A potential explanation for this is that students' motivation and engagement are inner processes that may be more difficult to detect than students' achievement (Friedrich, Jonkmann, Nagengast, Schmitz, & Trautwein, 2013). Moreover, teachers are typically not trained to assess students' motivational characteristics (Friedrich et al., 2013). As multi-informant perspectives are preferable and supplement self-ratings of social and academic well-being, further studies might train teachers to gauge students' SWB indicators (Friedrich et al., 2013), thus providing more accurate assessments of the emotional and motivational processes in students' behavior.
The greatest effect size in this study was observed in emotional engagement among the students in the intervention group. Key factors in the conceptualization of emotional engagement are students' affective reactions to their teachers and peers, and how close they feel to them (Fredricks et al., 2004). In transitioning from elementary to middle school, however, the quality of these relationships often faces the risk of decline. One reason for this is that middle school learning climate is fundamentally different than that of elementary school—students learn a variety of subjects and frequently move to different classrooms throughout the school day, which may weaken their relationships with certain teachers (Dodge & Sherrill, 2006). It is important, though, to note that studies found that when teachers led their middle-school students through individual or group coaching sessions throughout the week, students exhibited increases in emotional well-being and investment in learning (Green, Oades, & Robinson, 2012). This is applicable to the present study given that the homeroom teachers implemented the intervention, rather than an outside professional who is unaffiliated with the school (as is often the case in educational programs that are not part of the regular curriculum). We believe that the program provided students with the opportunity to interact with one another and their teachers, enabling a dialog that differed from the routine dialog between teachers and students, and potentially aided them in forging meaningful relationships with one another.
Another significant finding was that the program effects were discernible a year after its completion, indicating that the students seemed to have internalized the program's content, leading to behavioral changes with prolonged effects. Keeping this in mind, however, it is important to note that at the fourth evaluation period (a year after the program ended), the data reflected some decline in the intervention's effects. This suggests the necessity for either a longer intervention program or booster and maintenance sessions (Eyberg, Edwards, Boggs, & Foote, 1998), to preserve and further promote the elements that contributed to the students' SWB.
Contrary to expectations, the intervention program did not appear to impact the students' satisfaction with life. This finding is particularly surprising in light of the positive changes in the other emotional well-being indices. The explanation may perhaps lie in the global nature of the life satisfaction measure. In particular, the form measured general life satisfaction rather than satisfaction in specific areas of life, which if evaluated, could have provided a more nuanced understanding of the fluctuations in satisfaction relative to specific aspects of functioning.
The present study was the first to investigate the PERMA model (Seligman, 2011) in an educational context. Our findings reflected the notion that positive psychology-based education can indeed, produce improvements in the elements' central to students' well-being: positive emotions, engagement, positive relationships, and scholastic achievement. It is necessary to further investigate the mechanisms that underlie the changes we observed in students' social, emotional, and academic outcomes. For example, were the observed effects a function of increased perseverance and cognitive engagement while learning? Alternately, it is also plausible that increases in emotional resources from enhanced subjective well-being and the strengthening of meaningful bonds with the homeroom teachers may have generated these observed improvements in students' functioning. Future studies of this type should include assessment of these determinants as potential mediators in order to gain a better understanding of their relative impact on the complex relationship between students' psychological well-being and academic functioning. In addition, the study did not assess changes in students' sense of meaning, a component of PERMA that is significantly related to engagement and subjective well-being (Steger et al., 2008), and may have also been a significant mechanism underlying the effects of the present intervention.
4.2. Demographic characteristics, SWB, and school engagement
The exploratory question that examined the relative contribution of different demographic factors at the individual and class level to changes in SWB and academic functioning yielded interesting results. As predicted, a pronounced connection was found between students' age, gender, and SES and their baseline levels of SWB and school engagement, though these indices fluctuated over time. We found initial score differences by gender, with boys showing fewer negative emotions, more positive emotions, and lower school engagement compared to girls at the beginning of the study. However, it is not clear whether this reflects actual gender differences in SWB or is the merely the result of a known phenomenon of gender disparities in willingness to report negative emotions and distress (Hankin, Mermelstein, & Roesch, 2007).
In line with studies showing low SES to be associated with decreased SWB among adolescents (Hagquist, 2007), we found that students from families living below the poverty line exhibited lower levels of positive emotions, social relations, and cognitive engagement in school, and higher levels of negative emotions at the beginning of the study. However, they also demonstrated some improvement in positive emotions and peer relations from the beginning to the end of the study. The increased need for social belonging among students from low socioeconomic backgrounds is consistent with research showing that for at-risk children, social support beyond their immediate family can act as a stress-buffering protective factor (Shoshani, Nakash, Zubida, & Harper, 2014). In the present study, SES also had a decisive effect at the classroom level; specifically, classes with a larger proportion of students from low socioeconomic backgrounds were characterized at baseline by fewer positive emotions, lower educational engagement and peer relations, and lower grades, but showed increases in peer relations and school engagement over time.
Despite the influence of demographic variables on fluctuations in the dependent variables over time, we did not find a significant interaction between the effect of the intervention and the demographic variables. These mixed findings preclude any solid conclusions related to demographic variables. On one hand, this finding demonstrates the relevance of the program for children of different ages, genders, and socioeconomic backgrounds. It is possible that the intervention adopted a universal approach to addressing the basic elements of SWB that are applicable to various groups, thus facilitating inter-group effectiveness. On the other hand, positive psychology content can be particularly relevant to at-risk populations experiencing distress, due to its focus on cultivating essential personal and interpersonal resources for positive development, resilience, and coping (Shoshani, Mifano, & Czamanski-Cohen, 2016). It is possible that further emphasizing program elements that specifically relate to coping with stressful situations and crises would maximize the program's latent potential to benefit at-risk youth.
4.3. Limitations and directions for future research
There are several limitations that must be recognized in this study. First, the schools in this study volunteered to participate in the program. Unfortunately, we had no baseline data that could help us identify differences between the sample of the participating schools and the 33 schools that chose not to participate. A second limitation of the study was the process of randomization in this study, which took place at the classroom level. Although we did not receive any feedback regarding contamination or demoralization in the control group, it is impossible to monitor students' discussions among themselves (Flay & Collins, 2005).
A third limitation was that this study did not include an evaluation of the program effects on the teachers who underwent the positive psychology training. As the teacher was the one who shaped the emotional quality of the program content, it is possible that the teachers' emotional connection to the program content had a decisive effect that exceeded merely adhering to the guidelines and ensuring fidelity.
A fourth limitation was the significant number of adolescent self-report questionnaires, which likely resulted in over-estimates. It is also important to take into account that a self-report questionnaire was used to determine fidelity. In addition, fidelity of the teachers' training sessions was not measured, and should be addressed in future studies.
A fifth limitation is that the positive effects could be explained by a Hawthorne effect, which refers to the possibility that students in the intervention group experienced positive changes as a result of being treated differently and receiving more attention (Adair, 1984). In the absence of an active control group, it is difficult to determine whether additional components, beyond the special attention and close relationships with the teachers, were responsible for the effects that were found. In addition, the intervention seems highly vulnerable to the issue of demand characteristics (Nichols, & Maner, 2008), especially given the intervention's strong focus on positive factors that were central to the self-report measures.
A sixth limitation is that from a socio-ecological perspective, there are many factors outside of the intervention process that could have impacted the students' well-being and their school functioning, such as socio-political events in the country (Guttmann-Steinmetz et al., 2012, Shoshani and Slone, 2008), socio-economic changes, technological advances, and familial and social dynamics (Armstrong, Birnie-Lefcovitch, & Ungar, 2005). Moreover, there are several issues that could have reduced the generalizability and the external validity of the results. The intervention sessions were relatively lengthy (90-minute sessions every two weeks), which might limit the implementation of the program in other middle schools around the world, due to the loss of instructional time. In addition, the religious stories, despite being a small part of the program, might not be appropriate in other countries or cultures. Finally, the program took place in Israel, a country that has a complex and unique political context characterized by extended periods of political violence and war (Slone & Shoshani, 2014). The chronic exposure to political violence may affect adolescents' SWB and performance in school (Slone & Shoshani, 2006). Future research is necessary to understand the nuanced effects of the program when implemented in different cultures and various environments. The program is currently in its pilot implementation phase in Mexico and the USA and will undergo empirical evaluations. We believe that the results from these comparative cross-cultural studies will provide insights into the relevance of differing sociocultural contexts and school systems for the effectiveness of the Maytiv program.
4.4. Implications for practice
School psychologists who come in contact with adolescents from a variety of demographic backgrounds are in a unique position to institute interventions that can strengthen students' well-being (Moolla & Lazarus, 2014). The field of school psychology has made significant strides in building theories supported by evidence-based interventions that expand schools' clinical services to further support flourishing and SWB (Cohen, 2006). The professional expertise of school psychologists in counseling, research interpretation, and evaluation of programs place them in an excellent position to gain familiarity with the wide range of interventions in the field, and to choose the most appropriate interventions for their students' needs (Sheridan & Gutkin, 2000). In this sense, we believe that the Maytiv program can offer a unique addition to the school curriculum. As a multidimensional intervention, the program provides an umbrella of principles and elements that have previously been implemented separately in various programs.
At the practical level, it offers a “tool box” for teachers and students that contains an array of practices and material aimed at promoting well-being. Operating under the assumption that there are multiple pathways to SWB (Seligman, 2011), the Maytiv program was developed as an integrative intervention that can cater to children from diverse backgrounds, with varying needs. Furthermore, the fact that the teachers experience the intervention themselves within the framework of their training transforms the program into a tool available for school psychologists to promote awareness and well-being in the educational staff as well.
In addition, by participating in the intervention, the school staff is exposed to factors and mechanisms that underlie SWB that they might not have been aware of. Prior to the last 20 years, these concepts were scarcely addressed, but today character strengths and virtues (Peterson & Seligman, 2004), gratitude (Emmons & McCullough, 2003), compassion (Neff, 2009), flow (Csikszentmihalyi, 1991), hope (Marques et al., 2011), and kindness (Boehm & Lyubomirsky, 2009), are receiving increased attention and can be applied in therapeutic and educational settings.
4.5. Conclusion
In most contemporary societies, there is a broad consensus that educational systems should care for their students' welfare and their intellectual, social, emotional, moral, and behavioral development (Cohen, 2006). Thus, schools have a substantial influence on students' lives, and play an important role in their development, both formally and informally. This demands an expanded conceptualization of the school environment to include the domains of socio-emotional functioning, cognitive abilities, and character and moral development.
In the extensive theoretical and practical field of wellness-enhancement in schools, positive psychology offers a multi-dimensional model in which the promotion of positive character and moral traits, the cultivation of positive emotions and emotion regulation, nurturing supportive relationships, and fostering a sense of meaning, engagement, and achievement are the primary objectives. Essentially, positive psychology has the potential to be a unifying platform that bridges a variety of methods, such as social–emotional learning, positive youth development, character development, and resilience programs, which at present operate independently. This approach can unite varying perspectives on well-being to comprehensively address the issue of how best to promote the well-being of students. Rigorous research and on-going collaboration between orientations can pave the way for the emergence of a novel, integrative field of positive education.
