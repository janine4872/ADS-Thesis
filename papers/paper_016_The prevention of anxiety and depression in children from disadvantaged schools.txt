abstract
A randomised controlled trial evaluated the Aussie Optimism Program in preventing anxiety and
depression. Grade 7 students (n ¼ 496) from disadvantaged government schools in Perth Western
Australia, participated. Six schools were randomly assigned to Aussie Optimism and six schools received
their usual health education lessons. Students completed questionnaires on depression, anxiety, attribution style, and social skills. Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist. No significant group effects
were found for student-reported data. Parents of intervention group only students reported reductions in
internalizing problems at post-test. No follow-up group effects were significant. Students and teachers
found the program acceptable.

Anxiety and depression have become important targets for
prevention because of their early onset, significant health burden,
persistence into adulthood, and comorbidity with other problems
(Feldner, Zvolensky, & Schmidt, 2004; Horowitz & Garber, 2006).
Depression is often comorbid with, or follows childhood anxiety
(Flannery-Schroeder, 2006). Common psychosocial risk factors
such as parental depression, violence and loss events, having no
friends, and poor sibling relationships (Shanahan, Copeland, Costello, & Angold, 2008) have been identified, as well as cognitive
vulnerabilities (Gibb & Coles, 2005). Intervening with common risk
and protective factors in late childhood may lead to prevention for
both disorders in adolescence. This study investigates the efficacy
of a prevention program, the Aussie Optimism Program (AOP), which
targets social and cognitive risks for internalizing problems as part
of the primary school health curriculum.
Aussie Optimism has two components. Social Life Skills (SLS;
Roberts, Ballantyne, & van der Klift, 2003) was developed to overcome interpersonal risks, such as poor social skills and social
problem solving, lack of social support, (Goodman, Gravitt, & Kaslow, 1995; Rudolph, Hammen, & Burge, 1994), and friendship
difficulties (Shanahan et al., 2008). Optimistic Thinking Skills (OTS;
Roberts, Ballantyne, et al., 2003; Roberts, Roberts, et al., 2003)
targets cognitive vulnerabilities, including pessimistic attribution
style (Seligman, Reivich, Jaycox, & Gillham, 1995), negative selfperceptions and future expectations (Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery,
1979; Gibb & Coles, 2005). Rational problem solving and problemand emotion-focused coping are targeted to reduce stress (Grant
et al., 2006).
Depression prevention programs have achieved positive
outcomes for anxiety and vice versa. Roberts, Kane, Bishop,
Matthews, and Thomson (2004) found that the Penn Resilience
Program (PRP) resulted in reductions in anxiety at follow-up, and
anxiety mediated a 30-month reduction in depressive symptoms.
Gillham et al. (2006) child and parent version of PRP produced large
effects for anxiety and small to moderate effects for depression over
1-year follow-up. When implemented universally with children in
small groups, the Friends for Life anxiety prevention program
reduced anxiety and depressive symptoms for anxious children for
up to 12-months (Barrett, Farrell, Ollendick, & Dadds, 2006).
Recent reviews suggest that targeted programs (e.g., PRP and
Adolescents Coping with Stress) are more effective for depression
(Horowitz & Garber, 2006), but universal (e.g. Friends for Life) and
targeted programs (e.g., Dadds, Spence, Holland, Barrett, & Laurens,
1997; Queensland Early Intervention Anxiety Program) are effective
for anxiety (Feldner et al., 2004). AOP is implemented universally,
but targets students attending schools in low socio-economic areas,
with daily risks such as low family income, broken families, conflict,
and other stressful life events. It has a similar theoretical base to the
PRP, but incorporates techniques to change cognitions, emotions

and behaviors relevant to both anxiety and depression (e.g., Kendall,
2006; Seligman et al., 1995; Stark, 1990). Teachers implement the
program in upper primary classes as part of the health curriculum.
This study investigates the efficacy of AOP. We expected AOP to
reduce child and parent reports of anxiety and depressive symptoms compared to a usual care condition, and parent reports of
externalizing problems which are often co-morbid with depression
Angold, Costello, and Erkanli (1999). We expected AOP to enhance
social skills and optimistic attributional styles and that these would
mediate effects on anxiety and depression. Clinical effects predicted lower prevalence and incidence of children with clinical
symptoms in the AOP group. Maintenance of effects at 6- and
18-month high school follow-ups was expected. Moderation effects
of gender and student risk status are also investigated.
Method
Participants
Participants were 496 Grade 7 students, aged between 11 and 13
years (M ¼ 11.99, SD ¼ .33), from 12 government primary schools in
Perth, Western Australia. The schools were randomly sampled from
the lowest decile of socio-economic status (SES) based on the
Census Index of Relative Socio-economic Status (Australian Bureau
of Statistics, 1996). Pairs of schools were matched on SES, school
size, and number of Grade 7 students, and members of each pair
were randomised to conditions. There were 274 students (54.8%,
n ¼ 151 females) in the intervention group, and 222 (53.4%, n ¼ 119
females) in the control group. Participation rates were similar for
intervention (Student ¼ 89.3%; Parent ¼ 61.3%) and control groups
(Student ¼ 85.8%; Parent ¼ 56.5%). Deletion by case was used to
manage attrition. By 18-month follow-up, 75.4% (n ¼ 377) of the
students were available, but only 30% (n ¼ 207) of the parents. More
intervention students (28.8%, n ¼ 79) than control students (19.8%,
n ¼ 44) dropped out (c2 (1, N ¼ 496) ¼ 5.27, p ¼ .02) (Table 1).
Student measures
The Child Depression Inventory (CDI) measured depressive
symptoms (Kovacs, 1992). This scale assessed depressed affect,
somatic symptoms, depressive behaviour, low self-esteem, and
anhedonia (Cronbach’s a ¼ .86). A cut-off score of 15, recommended by Kovacs as indicating moderate to severe depressive
symptoms, identified 16.8% (n ¼ 73) high risk students. Pre-test CDI
scores correlated significantly with RCMAS scores (r ¼ .71) and
CASQ-R composite negative scores (r ¼.55). The pre-test mean, 7.85
(SD ¼ 7.24), was lower than the normative sample for 8–12 yearolds (M ¼ 10.5, SD ¼ 7.3).
The Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale (37-item RCMAS;
Reynolds & Richmond, 1985) assessed physiological symptoms,
worry, over-sensitivity, social and concentration concerns (Cronbach’s a ¼ .87; 9 month test-retest reliability ¼ .64). A cut-off score
of 16 was used to identify 17.3% (n ¼ 75) high risk children. This cutoff accorded with the CDI cut-off at one standard deviation above
the mean for 11-year-old boys and close to this score for 11-year-old
girls (Reynolds & Richmond). The mean pre-test score for this
sample (M ¼ 7.98, SD ¼ 6.60) was lower than the standardisation
sample (M ¼ 11.42, SD ¼ 5.75).
The Children’s Attributional Style Questionnaire – Revised
(24-item CASQ-R; Thompson, Kaslow, Weiss, & Nolen-Hoeksema,
1998) assessed attribution style for positive and negative events in
8–13-year-olds. Low composite positive (CP) scores and high
composite negative (CN) scores indicate pessimistic explanations.
Moderate internal consistency (CP: Cronbach a ¼ .53–.60; CN:
Cronbach a ¼ .45–.46) and test–retest reliability (CP: r ¼ .53; CN:
r ¼ .38) were reported. Significant correlations with the CDI total
(r ¼ .46 for CP; r ¼ .49 for CN) and the RCMAS total (r ¼  .41 for
CP; r ¼ .34 for CN) indicated good convergent validity.
The Matson Evaluation of Social Skills with Youngsters (38-item
MESSY; Matson, Macklin, & Helsel, 1985) measured appropriate
social skills and inappropriate assertiveness. Higher scores indicated poorer social skills. Spearman–Brown correlation coefficients
were .94 (appropriate social skills) and .98 (inappropriate assertiveness). Test–retest reliability over 9 months was .52 for appropriate social skills and .57 for inappropriate assertiveness.
Inappropriate assertiveness correlated .33 with the RCMAS social
concerns subscale, and .44 with the CDI total. Factorial validity has
been established for 4-18-year olds.
Student process evaluation
Social Life and Optimistic Thinking measures were developed.
Each comprised 25 statements on program satisfaction and the
usefulness of skills taught, rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 1
(not at all) to 5 (very much). Students indicated the activities they
enjoyed and skills they used most.
Parental measures

established in many studies cross-culturally (Achenbach, 1991).
Total raw scores ranged from 0 to 62 for internalizing, and 0 to 66
for externalizing. Cronbach a was .89 for boys and .90 for girls for
internalizing, and .93 for externalizing in both genders. One week
test–retest reliability for internalizing was .90 for boys and .87 for
girls; and for externalizing, .91 for boys and .95 for girls (Achenbach). Externalizing correlated with student inappropriate social
skills (r ¼ .275, p < .01), and internalizing with the CDI (r ¼ .29,
p < .01) and the RCMAS (r ¼ .33, p < .01).
Teacher measures
Program integrity
Program integrity was assessed by teacher logbooks, student
workbook samples, and blind independent observations of three
randomly selected lessons per teacher. Teacher logbooks included
a checklist for each lesson and a 10-point overall success rating
scale (1 ¼ little success, 10 ¼ highly successful). These were cross
checked against five randomly sampled student workbooks from
each class. Independent observers completed the same logbooks
for observing lessons.
Procedure
Ethical approval was granted by the Curtin University Human
Ethics Committee in 2000. Data were collected from 2000 to
2003. Principals were invited by letter and a phone call to
participate in the study. A presentation was then made to the
principal and Grade 7 teachers in Term 1. All 12 schools consented
and were then advised on their condition. Active consent was
requested from Grade 7 students and their parents. Information
letters were forwarded to parents on school letterhead, and
parent information sessions were conducted at each school.
Parents agreed to participate by returning an active consent form.
Where consent forms were not returned by a due date, parents
were asked to return a non-consent form if they did not want to
participate, otherwise the child was included in the study. This
active/passive consent procedure was approved by the Curtin
University Human Ethics Committee in 2000. Active consent was
given by 84.6% of parents (n ¼ 424). The remaining 15.4% (n ¼ 77)
consented passively.
Questionnaires were read to whole classes by trained research
assistants, blind to group allocation. Students were made aware of
their rights to withdraw from the study at any point, thanked for
their participation, and all questions were answered. Pre-test
assessments were conducted in Term 1 Grade 7 and post-test
assessments in Term 4 Grade 7. The 6- and 18-month follow-ups
were conducted in the middle of Grades 8 and 9 after students had
moved to high school. Pre- and post-test, parent questionnaires
were sent home with students and returned to their child’s school
in a sealed envelope. Both follow-up questionnaires were mailed to
parents and returned in pre-paid envelopes. Phone contact was
used to enhance response rates at each assessment. Where questionnaires indicated clinical scores, parents were contacted by
a psychologist and provided with advice on management and
appropriate referral services.
Intervention and control conditions
Intervention group
The Aussie Optimism Program included two components: SLS
(Roberts, Ballantyne, et al., 2003) and OTS (Roberts, Ballantyne,
et al., 2003; Roberts, Roberts, et al., 2003). These components each
contained ten 60-minute lessons to be taught at times convenient
to the teachers (see Table 2). The lessons included didactic
information; interactive activities such as role-plays, games, and
co-operative learning tasks; cross curriculum applications; worksheets; and homework activities to integrate skills into the home
setting. Each lesson related to interpersonal or self-management
skills, consistent with the Western Australian Health Education
Curriculum. Teachers implemented one module per week for
20 weeks.
Ten intervention group teachers completed 16 hours of training,
consisting of information on the symptoms and burden of anxiety
and depression, mental health promotion strategies, activity
demonstrations, skills practice and feedback, and discussion of
implementation issues for individual classrooms. These teachers
received program manuals, resources, and student workbooks,
plus eight 60-minute coaching sessions to support the
implementation.
Control group
Control group teachers implemented 20 regular health education lessons relating to self-management and interpersonal skills.
They used a variety of resources, but the lessons had similar
learning outcomes as AOP. A 30-minute presentation on building
resilience within the school curriculum was conducted for these
teachers. Control group teachers received training and resources in
Year 2 of the research project.
Results
Design and data analysis
A cluster randomised control trial with a treatment as usual
control group was conducted. Primary outcomes comprised
student reports of anxiety and depression, and parent reports of
internalizing symptoms. Secondary outcomes included student
reported social skills and attribution style, and parent reports of
externalizing symptoms.
A two-group (intervention versus control) ANCOVA for each
outcome was conducted at each post-intervention assessment. In
order to control for intra-school dependencies in the data, school
was included as a nested factor (SPSS 15.0, 2006). Chi-square and
logistic regressions investigated clinical significance (STATA 10,
StataCorp, 2007). A similar study by Roberts et al. (2004) reported
‘small’ to ‘moderate’ CDI effects, ICCs of .02, within-group variability of 63, and pre-post correlations on the outcome of .64.
Inputting these values to Murray, Varnells, and Blitstein (2004)
formula indicated 10 schools with 30 students each for an 80%
chance of detecting intervention effects at a ¼ .05.
Primary outcome analyses
No significant group effects were found for depression at posttest (F [1, 14.03] ¼ .76, p ¼ .397, h2 ¼ .05), 6-months follow-up

16.34] ¼ .349, p ¼ .56, h2 ¼ .02). Neither were there significant
group effects for anxiety at post-test (F [1, 12.54] ¼ 3.54, p ¼ .08,
h2 ¼ .22), 6-months follow-up (F [1, 11.59] ¼ .83, p ¼ .67, h2 ¼ .067),
or 18-months follow-up (F [1, 15.83] ¼ 3.61, p ¼ .08, h2 ¼ .186).
Table 3 shows that the mean scores for both groups declined over
time within the normal range on the CDI and the RCMAS.
Compared to control parents, intervention parents reported
significantly lower levels of child internalizing problems at posttest (F[1, 12.58] ¼ 6.10, p ¼ .029, h2 ¼ .327), but no significant
differences in child externalizing problems (F[1, 11.64] ¼ 3.92,
p ¼ .07, h2 ¼ .252). Group effects were no longer evident at
6-months follow-up (Internalizing: F[1, 16.45] ¼ 3.63, p ¼ .074,
h2 ¼ .181; Externalizing: F [1, 12.73] ¼ .065, p ¼ .80, h2 ¼ .005) or
18-month follow-up (Internalizing: F[1, 14.38] ¼ 1.74, p ¼ .21,
h2 ¼ .108; Externalizing: F [1, 1 5.96] ¼ .667, p ¼ .43, h2 ¼ .04).
Random effects regression analyses, to control for the school
effects, indicated that neither student pre-test risk status (high or
low) nor gender moderated intervention effects on post-intervention levels of depression or anxiety (p-values ranged .052–.982).
Time effects
At post-test, intervention parents reported a significant reduction in internalizing problems within the normative range (F [1,
134] ¼ 8.35, p ¼ .004, h2 ¼ .059), while control group parents
reported no change in symptoms (F [1, 101] ¼ .88, p ¼ .35, h2 ¼ .009)
Table 4.
Secondary outcomes analyses
There were no significant group effects for either positive (PA) or
negative attributions (NA) at post-test (PA: F [1, 13.42] ¼ .48, p ¼ .50,
h2 ¼ .03; NA: F [1, 12.41] ¼ 1.57, p ¼ .23, h2 ¼ .112), 6-months (PA: F
[1, 20.52] ¼ .02, p ¼ .88, h2 ¼ .001; NA: F [1, 14.48] ¼ .45, p ¼ .51,
h2 ¼ .03), or 18-months (PA: F [1, 13.13] ¼ .09, p ¼ .76, h2 ¼ .007; NA:
F [1, 12.94] ¼ .29, p ¼ .60, h2 ¼ .02). Similarly no significant group
effects for social skills were observed, (Post-test: F [1, 16.29] ¼ 1.06,
p ¼ .39, h2 ¼ .06; 6-month: F [1, 12.18] ¼ .86, p ¼ .37, h2 ¼ .07; and
18-months: F [1, 13.97] ¼ 2.85, p ¼ .11, h2 ¼ .17).
Risk group analysis
There were no significant group differences in the prevalence of
high risk students with clinical CDI and/or RCMAS scores; 27.8%
(n ¼ 77) of intervention and 25.1% (n ¼ 56) of control group
students at pre-test, 16.1% (n ¼ 37) and 11.8% (n ¼ 20) at 6-months,
and 14.4% (n ¼ 29) and 11.9% (n ¼ 22) at 18-month follow-up.
However, at post-test the proportion of students reporting high risk
levels of internalizing problems was significantly larger in the
intervention group, 22.4% (n ¼ 54), compared to the control group,
13%, (n ¼ 25), c2
[1, N ¼ 434] ¼ 6.43 p ¼ .01. This represented a 5%
drop in the intervention group and 12% for the control group.
Binary logistic regression, indicated that pre-test risk status
accounted for 20.3% of the variance in the likelihood of being in the
high risk group at post-test (Nagelkerke R2 ¼ .203, p ¼ .000), while
the intervention only accounted for an additional 2.6% of the variance (Nagelkerke R2 change ¼ .026, p ¼ .006).
Chi-square analyses on the incidence of new high risk cases in
pre-test healthy students indicated no significant differences. At
post-test there were 21 (11.6%) new cases in the intervention
group versus 10 (6.9%) in the control group. At 6-months there
were 10 (6%) new intervention cases and 4 (3.2%) control cases.
By 18-months follow-up the intervention group had only 5
(3.5%) new cases, with 4 (3%) in the control group. However,
more control group (n ¼ 31, 68.9%) versus intervention group
students (n ¼ 25, 44.6%) recovered from high risk status at posttest (c2
[1, N ¼ 101] ¼ 5.94, p ¼ .015). This result was influenced
by the 7.9% (n ¼ 18) of control students versus 3.5% (n ¼ 10) of
intervention students who received mental health help between
pre- and post-test. No other group recovery differences occurred
over time.
Teacher and student evaluations
The mean percentage of content covered for the Social Life Skills
(SLS) lessons reported by teachers and cross checked against
student workbooks ranged from 87.3% to 98.3% (M ¼ 95.3%). For the
Optimistic Thinking Skills (OTS) lessons, mean percentage of content
covered per lesson was 97.5–100% (M ¼ 98.04%). There was 100%
agreement between independent observers and teachers. Independent observers’ mean ratings of overall lesson success was high,
M ¼ 8.37, (SD ¼ .93) for SLS, and M ¼ 8.85, (SD ¼ 1.01) for OTS.
Student attendance checklists indicated that only 5.2% of students
were absent for more than 25% of the SLS lessons, while 31.4% of
students missed up to 25% of the modules. Nine percent of students
were absent for more than 25% of the OTS lessons, while 46.6% of
the students missed up to 25% of the modules.
Teachers positively endorsed the program. They reported that
the structure of the program provided students with a safe environment in which to discuss personal issues and they noted
a number of positive changes in the students, including increased
confidence among quieter students, and a reduction in bullying
behavior. The teachers also reported increased confidence in their
own ability to deal with interpersonal conflicts in the school
environment after implementing the program.
The percentage of students, who rated the utility of SLS lessons
as average or above, ranged from 68.7% for ‘‘Learning about How to
Get Along With Family Members’’ to 79.0% for ‘‘Learning How to be
Assertive’’. For OTS, 67.3% of the students gave ratings of average or

(MSLS ¼ 3.53, MOTS ¼ 3.06). Student satisfaction levels were slightly
above average for SLS (M ¼ 3.15, SD ¼ .96), and slightly below
average for OTS (M ¼ 2.78, SD ¼ 1.00). Students reported more
satisfaction with SLS (t(223) ¼ 6.49, p < .01). The SLS program
(M ¼ 3.94, SD ¼ 1.01) was also rated more highly than OTS
(M ¼ 3.47, SD ¼ 1.15) on ease of understanding (t(223) ¼ 5.91,
p < .01). Students nominated SLS module ‘‘Learning to negotiate’’ as
the most enjoyable (44 nominations), while "Networks" was
nominated the least enjoyable module (27 students). Both student
and teacher reports indicated that role-plays were the most
popular activities. Students reported using SLS assertiveness the
most (71 endorsements). For OTS, games and quizzes were listed as
the most enjoyable activities (84 students). The skill most used
from OTS was awareness of and tuning into ‘‘self-talk’’, endorsed by
53 students. Identifying and changing ‘‘Pest Thoughts’’ was the
second most popular OTS activity (44 students).
Discussion
Contrary to expectations, student reports of anxiety and
depression showed no significant group differences at any assessment point. Instead, the means for both groups declined within the
normal range over time. Expected effects were found for intervention group parents, who reported lower levels of internalizing
problems than controls at post-test. However, this effect was not
sustained and was not apparent for externalizing problems. There
were no group effects on the risk and protective factors targeted by
the intervention nor were moderator effects apparent for pre-test
risk status or gender. While it is gratifying that parents of intervention children noticed fewer internalizing symptoms in their
children after the intervention, these results are disappointing.
The lack of effect on primary outcomes could reflect the low pretest levels of student internalizing symptoms, despite their low SES
risk status. This is unlikely to be a sampling effect, as 88% of the
available students participated. However, students may have
minimised their symptoms, as parent data indicated rates of
internalizing and externalizing problems above those of an
Australian prevalence study (Sawyer et al., 2000). Students who
dropped out had higher self and parent-reported pre-test symptoms. Hence, the power to detect group effects was reduced,
particularly at 18-months follow-up.
At pre-test, approximately 25% of students reported high risk
symptom levels. This proportion decreased in both groups over time.
However, more intervention group students remained high risk at
post-test compared to the control group. The incidence of new high
risk cases decreased over time for both groups, but fewer high risk
intervention group students recovered at post-test. This was related
to a higher proportion of high risk students in the intervention group
at pre-test, and twice as many control students receiving help for
mental health problems between pre- and post-test.
Program implementation, fidelity, and student attendance were
high. Hence, it is unlikely that the program was ineffective because
of poor implementation or low student participation rates. Qualitative feedback from teachers suggests that they were satisfied
with the program content and were able to implement the activities confidently. However, as teachers taught classes of 20–30
students, it is possible that the dose of the program received by
individual children was low. AOP targeted largely individual
cognitive and social risk and protective factors for depression and
anxiety, but did not intervene with family or school factors.
Parental depression, rejecting or controlling disciplinary styles,
parent–child conflict and school violence/bullying are also associated with depression and anxiety (Shanahan et al., 2008). AOP did
not specifically target these factors, which may have had an impact
on recovery rates. Future research would do well to incorporate
parent and school components.
This universal trial with low SES students had more limited
outcomes than Gillham et al.’s (2006) indicated trial of PRP and
a universal trial of the Friends for Life program (Barrett et al., 2006).
AOP has a similar theoretical basis as PRP, but it was implemented by
teachers with whole classes, without a parent program. Differences in
theimplementationmay explain these results. PRPisimplemented by
psychologists in small groups of 10–15 students, as is Friends for Life
albeit at times with school staff. In comparison, AOP is curriculumbased and implemented by teachers with whole classes. While
program integrity and students satisfaction was good, students may
have had limited practice or individualised feedback with this format.
Small group formats are more costly for schools, but they do provide
more individual practice particularly for high risk students.
The strengths of this study included a high student recruitment
rate. Both student and parents were used to measure outcomes,
and teachers and independent observers assessed program integrity. The study was conducted under real world conditions which
were acceptable to schools and conducive to sustainability, and the
intervention was relatively inexpensive. These features are attractive from a public health stance. However, if such a program has
limited effects observed only by parents, it will not result in
significant prevention effects.
In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that a universal
cognitive-behavioral intervention developed to be integrated into
the primary school curriculum can be taught by regular classroom
teachers. Support for the efficacy of the program came from
parental reports only. However, in the current format, AOP has not
been associated with consistent short or long-term effects for
internalizing symptoms. A small group format may provide a more
intensive and individualised experience for students at high risk. In
addition, significant family risk and protective factors were not

addressed by this program. For the future, an adjunctive program
that targets family risk and protective factors for childhood anxiety
and depression may enhance the program efficacy. In addition,
booster sessions or spreading the 20 modules over the final two
years of primary school, may improve the efficacy of the program.
These changes would provide opportunities for more guided
practice and reinforcement of the skills over a longer time period.
This study indicates that the challenge remains to provide
sustainable prevention programs, which can be easily implemented
within schools, providing effective and affordable prevention for
anxiety and depression.
