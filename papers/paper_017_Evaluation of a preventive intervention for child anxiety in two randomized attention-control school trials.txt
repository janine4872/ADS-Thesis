Abstract
The present research examined the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) based intervention program, FRIENDS, for children from grades 4 to 6, using random assignment at the school-level and an attention-control design in two longitudinal studies. The first study targeted children with anxiety symptoms (N = 191, mean age = 10.1) as screened with self, parent, and teacher-reports; the second study took a universal approach with full classrooms of children participating (N = 253, mean age = 9.8). The results showed no intervention effect in both studies, with children’s anxiety symptoms decreasing over time regardless of whether they were in the story-reading (attention control) or FRIENDS condition. The findings also indicated that girls reported a higher level of anxiety than boys and children in higher grades reported lower anxiety relative to younger children in both studies. In addition, similar patterns were found using a subgroup of children with high-anxiety symptoms from both studies.

Anxiety disorders in children are widely understood to be prevalent, persistent, and responsive to psychological intervention (Barrett et al., 1996, Kendall et al., 1997, Wittchen et al., 2000). With prevalence rates ranging from 10 to 17%, anxiety disorders are the most common cause of referral to children’s mental health-care providers (March & Albano, 1998), and predominantly have an onset in childhood or early adolescence (Kessler et al., 2005, Wittchen et al., 2000). Sequelae include increased mood disorders, substance use disorders, higher rates of smoking tobacco, and suicidality (for review see Ost & Treffers, 2001). These disorders pervade and impair many domains of critical child development including the ability to function at school, with peers, at home and in the community (see also Neil & Christensen, 2009).
With emphasis on importing evidence-based protocols into “real world” settings, cognitive-behavioral (CBT) interventions targeting anxiety in community settings, such as schools, is becoming increasingly popular (Durlak et al., 2004, Lowry-Webster et al., 2001, Stallard et al., 2007). Schools are a promising site for prevention and early intervention efforts not only due to the sustained daily contact with children, but also to advantages of reduced stigma, easier access to treatment, and naturally occurring peer-to-peer support. This approach has potential to decrease the “burden of suffering” caused by child psychiatric disorder by better meeting the needs of the more than 70% of children who need, but do not receive, psychological treatments (Offord, Kraemer, Kazdin, Jensen, & Harrington, 1998).
Mounting pressure for more comprehensive, integrated programs to address the mental health needs of children (World Health Organization, 2004) has resulted in more anxiety prevention and early intervention research trials in schools (Barrett and Turner, 2001, Bernstein et al., 2005, Lowry-Webster et al., 2001). Effectiveness studies with school-based samples have shown mixed results. Barrett and Turner (2001) and Lowry-Webster et al. (2001) conducted the first studies examining universal programming for preventing childhood anxiety using the manualized CBT-based intervention program, FRIENDS (Barrett, Lowry-Webster, & Turner, 2000), their adaptation of Kendall’s (1994) widely used and effective protocol, Coping Cat. In their large trial (N = 594), Lowry-Webster et al. reported an overall decrease in anxiety symptoms in all children at post-test, with a significantly greater decrease for the intervention group compared to the control group (on one of two self-report measures used). Results were consistent at 12-month follow-up, when a greater number of intervention participants remained diagnosis-free. Similarly, in their study of 489 children, Barrett and Turner (2001) reported significant decreases in self-reported anxiety symptoms compared to the monitoring condition, providing initial support for universal prevention approaches to child anxiety.
Similar group CBT clinical protocols for anxiety intervention have been evaluated in at-risk or symptomatic children in schools (Bernstein et al., 2005, Dadds et al., 1999, Dadds et al., 1997). In their study of 128 school children, Dadds et al. (1997) found no significant difference in percentage meeting anxiety diagnosis between group CBT and a monitoring condition at post-intervention. However, at 6-month follow-up, improvements were maintained by children in the intervention condition only. Follow-up revealed that group differences disappeared at one-year, but were evident again at two-years. In their school-based sample of 425 socioeconomically disadvantaged children, Mifsud and Rapee (2005) also reported decreased anxiety on child- and teacher-reports at post-test for their intervention compared to waitlist control.
Scant research utilizing attention-control conditions, designed to control for expectancy and the nonspecific effects of intervention, has been conducted. Of the 24 randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of psychological treatment of child anxiety disorders reviewed by In-Albon and Schneider (2007), only four studies used an attention placebo control condition, with a global effect size of 0.58. Two studies are notable exceptions for their inclusion of an education support condition as a control, although they are clinic-based (Last et al., 1997, Silverman et al., 1999). Silverman et al. examined the effectiveness of exposure-based contingency management and exposure-based cognitive self-control interventions, relative to an education support control condition, in a clinic-based sample of 104 children with phobias. Their results showed that all three conditions effectively produced and maintained treatment gains, with comparable (and nonsignificant) patterns across all measures and multiple sources (parent, child, therapist). Similar results were also reported by Last et al. in their study of 32 school-phobic children who received either individual CBT or education support. No studies reported in the literature of randomized school trials used an attention or alternate condition.
In the present research, we used a randomized, attention-control design with two community samples of children enrolled in public elementary schools. The primary purpose of this research was to investigate the effectiveness of both targeted (Study 1) and universal (Study 2) applications of a cognitive-behavioral protocol (FRIENDS) for preventing and reducing anxiety symptoms in children within the school setting over a period of 17 months. Our hypothesis was that the intervention group would report a greater decrease in anxiety symptoms at post-intervention (2.5 months) than the attention-control group, and that anxiety levels would be maintained or continue to reduce in small magnitude over time. In addition, the present research also examined whether the FRIENDS program was effective for a high-anxiety symptom subgroup.
Method
Participants
The University’s institutional review board approved both studies. Written parental active consent and child assent were required as was child English language proficiency. Parents were sent home consent forms and parent-report measures via their child, with invitation to complete and return them to their child’s school in a sealed envelope. During this same time period, children completed their self-report measure. All children participated in the screening process at school district request, in order to have all children feel included in the project, with the proviso that all data collected from those without consent would be eliminated from the study. Teachers were blinded to which children had parental consent to participate in data collection. The studies were conducted in two different urban school districts in western Canada over a two-year period.
Study 1: Targeted
All children in grades 4–6 (N = 998) in the 17 participating elementary schools (year 1 = 6 schools, year 2 = 11 schools) were screened in order to determine children’s level of anxiety symptoms (see Fig. 1). Following the screening, children were invited to participate in the study if their self-reported anxiety total score was elevated (T-score of 56 or higher; March, 1997). If a child’s anxiety score did not fit this criterion, but a parent and/or teacher indicated anxiety was a concern on a brief checklist of anxiety symptoms, the child was selected for participation. Not all selected children received parental consent to participate. The final sample consisted of 191children (48% girls) with a mean age of 10.1 (SD = .93). Notably, 48% of the sample reported speaking a language other than English in the home (predominately Chinese, 18%, with over twelve other languages represented). The diversity in home language may have affected lower rates of active parental consent.

Study 2: Universal
All children in grades 4–6 (N = 373) in the seven participating elementary schools (see Fig. 2) received the intervention. However, because some parents did not return the consent form or refused the use of data from their child, a total of 253 children with an average age of 9.8 (SD = .78) was eligible for data analyses. Among them, 54% were girls and 18% spoke a language other than English in the home.

Measures
Children completed the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC; March, 1997). The MASC is a 39-item self-report measure of anxiety symptoms and produces an overall anxiety score and composite scores. Raw scores are converted to T-scores. The MASC shows acceptable internal consistency (.90) and test-retest reliability (.72–.93), and captures clinically relevant anxiety symptoms both at the factor and item level (March, 1997, March et al., 1997). Children completed the MASC in the classroom, with instructions and items read aloud by trained graduate research assistants. The MASC demonstrated high internal reliability in the present studies, with coefficient alphas ranging from.90 to.92.
For children with parental consent to participate, parents and teachers completed the Behavioral Assessment System for Children (Parent and Teacher Report Forms) (BASC; Reynolds & Kamphaus, 1992). The BASC teacher report consists of 148 items related to behaviors that can be observed in the school setting, and the parent report consists of 138 behavioral items based on behaviors that can be observed in both home and community settings. The BASC anxiety subscale was of primary interest, comprised of 8 or 11 items for teacher and parent reports, respectively. Psychometric properties for the BASC are acceptable, with Cronbach alphas ranging from .74 to.90 and from.86 to.97 for subscales and composites, respectively, high test re-test and inter-rater reliabilities (Flanagan, 1995).
Procedures
For Study 1, assessments occurred across four time points: 1) pre-intervention (Time-1); 2) following the first 9-week intervention phase (Time-2, 2.5 months); 3) following the second 9-week intervention phase (delayed intervention, Time-3, 5 months); and 4) one-year follow-up (Time-4, 17 months after baseline). Study 2 utilized the same time points with the exception of Time-3 as that district did not permit data collection at that time.
Schools were matched by socioeconomic status and randomly assigned to either intervention (FRIENDS) or attention control. Randomization occurred at the school-level, rather than classroom level, in order to: 1) reduce spillover (i.e., contamination effects) and 2) preserve the integrity of the research (Bloom, 2005). Study 1 included participants from 17 schools, and Study 2 from 7 schools (14 classrooms). FRIENDS (Barrett et al., 2000) is a manualized, CBT-based group activity curriculum for grades 4–6. FRIENDS teaches children to identify and understand anxiety signals, physical/bodily symptoms, worried thoughts, and maladaptive behaviors associated with feeling worried or anxious. FRIENDS is an acronym that helps children to recall the coping and problem solving skills taught. These include: F, feeling worried; R, relax and feel good; I, inner thoughts; E, explore plans of action; N, nice work, reward yourself; D, don’t forget to practice these new skills; and S, smile, stay cool and calm. Schools assigned to the intervention implemented the FRIENDS program within small groups (Study 1) or classrooms (Study 2) over nine weekly 1-h sessions at school during the regular school day. FRIENDS was implemented in each school by the trained school person (i.e., teacher) paired with a trained school counselor (or trained psychology graduate student).
In order to assess fidelity to the FRIENDS program, random audiotape recordings (N = 47, or 25% of total) covering six different sessions were rated for adherence to the protocol by two trained (blinded) graduate students. Adherence, using a Likert-scaled checklist of program objectives, ranged from 76.85% (Study 2) to 79.51% (Study1).
The attention-control condition entailed reading an adventure story (e.g., Harry Potter; Rowling, 1999) to the students in small groups (Study 1) or classrooms (Study 2) by either a graduate student or a teacher-facilitator, simultaneously to the same time period of FRIENDS. Students in both conditions were encouraged to participate by reminding them that we were from the university, by asking for their help in conducting research, and by rewards of weekly snacks at each session. We deemed that this would raise expectancy, as important adults reading aloud are more novel in upper grades. The book was unable to be completed within nine sessions. After post-test (Time-2), school personnel from the attention-control schools were then trained and subsequently implemented the program. Thus, by the end of the academic year (Time 3, June, 5 months), all children in both studies had received the intervention, yielding no true control sample for assessing longer-term maintenance.
Training of group facilitators took place over one school day (6-hours in-service training) and consisted of an interactive lecture on the behavioral manifestations of anxiety, etiology of anxiety disorders, research support for psychological interventions, and FRIENDS implementation. The standardized training day content was developed and delivered by the first author. In order to reduce bias, two training days were provided, one in January (for active intervention facilitators) and the other in April (for attention-control facilitators prior to intervention). Teachers were supported by weekly contact from the researchers, reinforcing objectives and goals of each session. Additionally, our research office was available daily for phone consultation.
Data analysis
The missing value analysis indicates that the assumption of MCAR was met for both studies. Little’s chi-square tests of Missing Completely At Random (MCAR test; Little, 1988) were not statistically significant, χ2(1527) = 1582, p = .157 for the targeted intervention study, and χ2(667) = 713, p = .104 for the universal study. However, given the concern that the large missing proportion of outcome variables may result in less power, we conducted analyses using both the data with missing values and the data with multiple imputation via Schafer’s Pan program (Zhao, 2009). The results obtained from both data sources were similar with an exception of the results for the high-anxiety subgroup in the universal study. Because the HLM program does not provide model fit indices for the analysis with multiply imputed datasets, the results reported here are based on the data with missing values. Given the low response rates by both teachers and parents, we only report descriptive statistics on the BASC for both studies (Table 1).

MASC scores are presented in the form of T-scores.
Two analyses were conducted for both studies. First, a three-level 2-piece linear growth model was conducted using HLM 6.02 program (Raudenbush, Bryke, & Congdon, 2005): (a) level-1 is intra-individual level; (b) level-2 is inter-individual level; and (c) level-3 is either school level (Study 1) or classroom level (Study 2)1 (see Appendix). The comparison of MASC scores by condition at Time-2 is of interest because the effectiveness of the FRIENDS program can only be tested at Time-2. Following Raudenbush and Bryke (2002, p. 179), we utilized a coding scheme that resulted in the intercept at Time-2, which allowed us to test our hypothesis and also allowed two growth rates to be different during two different time periods (see Appendix).
The tests of Estimated Marginal Means (EMM) were also conducted on MASC scores for both studies in order to provide further information on the within-group change over time via the repeated measures ANCOVA with Bonferroni correction. Because the results obtained from HLM analyses showed no differences on the two condition groups, we did not separate them for the EMM tests.
The same analyses of HLM and EMM tests were conducted for the high-anxiety symptom subgroup (T-score > 65 at baseline) in order to examine whether FRIENDS was more effective for this subgroup. Because of the small sample sizes for the subgroups in both studies, two-level HLM models were adopted for the analyses, and hence the dependency of students within the same schools or classrooms cannot be taken into account.
In addition, using the formula provided by Spybrook, Raudenbush, Congdon, and Martinez (2009, p. 121), we calculated the effect size of treatment effects only for the targeted study with the full sample. However, we did not compute the effect size for the universal study with the full sample because one key residual variance had to be fixed to zero for the purpose of convergence, which would result in a biased effect size. The sample size of the high-anxiety subgroups was too small for conducting 3-level HLM analysis and the school variation was unable to be taken into account, so the effect size estimates may be misleading.
Results
Comparison of total enrolled sample
Study 1: Targeted intervention
Table 1 presents means and standard deviations for the child self-report (MASC), teacher report (BASC-T), and parent report (BASC-P). Participants were unbalanced (65 vs. 126) due to the effects of randomization by school (elementary schools vary by size). The analysis at baseline revealed no significant differences found in child self-reported anxiety (MASC) baseline scores between the two conditions t(189) = 1.342, p = .181. Therefore, the randomization process was regarded as successful.
Table 2 presents the results of the unconditional and conditional 2-piece linear growth model. The unconditional model showed no variation on the growth rate (1) at individual level (level-2) and the growth rate (2) across schools (level-3), so that growth rate (2) at level-3 was fixed in the present study. However, the growth rate (1) at level-2 was not fixed for the purpose of calculation of effect sizes. Thus, no explanatory variables were included to explain the variation of the growth rate (1) at level-2 and that of the growth rate-2 at level-3. The deviance difference test showed that the inclusion of explanatory variables significantly improved the model fit, χ2(8) = 20.43, p < .001. The conditional model revealed that there were gender and grade differences on the initial status, γ010 = 8.295, p < .001 and γ020 = −2.836, p < .05, indicating that girls had higher levels of anxiety than boys and children in higher grades had lower anxiety at Time-2. However, treatment effects were not found on either the initial status or growth rate (1), γ001 = 1.193, p > .05 (effect size = .073) and γ101 = −0.848. p > .05 (effect size = .338). As there was no school variation for growth rate (2), the treatment effects were unable to be tested for growth rate (2). Therefore, contrary to our hypothesis, after receiving a 9-week FRIENDS program, the intervention group did not report a greater decrease in anxiety symptoms than the attention-control group. The two growth rates showed different patterns: after controlling for effects of condition, gender, grade and ESL, children had a bigger drop on the levels of anxiety symptoms in the first 2.5 months, γ100 = −1.744, p < .05, but had a slower rate of decrease over the next 14.5 months, γ200 = −0.752, p < .01.

Study 2: Universal intervention
Table 1 presents means and standard deviations for the child self-report (MASC), teacher report (BASC-T), and parent report (BASC-P). Preliminary analyses at baseline revealed no significant difference in child self-reported anxiety (MASC) baseline scores between the two conditions (intervention vs. attention control), t(235) = −.232, p = .817.
Table 2 presents the results of the unconditional and conditional 2-piece linear growth model. The growth rate (1) at level-2, growth rate (2) at level-3 and initial status at level-3 were fixed in the present study because the unconditional model showed no variation on these parameters. Unlike Study 1, we had to fix growth rate (1) at level-2 because of the convergence problem, and hence the effect size for the treatment effect was not calculated for this study. In addition, no explanatory variables were included to explain the variation of growth rate (1) at level-2, growth rate (2) at level-3 and initial status at level-3. The deviance difference test showed that the inclusion of explanatory variables significantly improved the model fit, χ2(7) = 25.03, p < .001. The conditional model revealed that there were gender and grade differences on the intercept (γ010 = 6.441, p < .001 and γ020 = −3.587, p < .01), indicating that girls had higher levels of anxiety than boys at Time-2, and children in higher grades had lower levels of anxiety than those in lower grades. However, no differences were found between the two condition groups on growth rate (1), γ101 = 0.678, p > .05. Because there was no school variation, treatment effects were unable to be tested for initial status and growth rate (2). The overall findings are similar to Study 1: no intervention effect was found on the intercept or for either of the two growth rates. In general, children had a faster rate of decrease of anxiety symptoms in the first 2.5 months, γ100 = −1.697, p < .05, but had no statistically significant decrease over the next 14.5 months, γ200 = −0.216, p > .05.
Table 3 presents the results of EMM tests on MASC scores along three time points. All the paired comparisons are statistically significant. The results suggest that children’s anxiety levels decreased over time overall, which is consistent with our findings obtained from the 2-piece linear growth model and echoes the Study 1 findings.
Comparison of high-anxiety symptom subgroup
A second set of analyses was conducted with a subgroup of children with high MASC scores (T-score > 65). The same analyses used for the full sample were conducted for the high-anxiety symptom groups, but the parameters of the intercept and growth rates were not allowed to vary across schools/classrooms. In addition, we included fewer explanatory variables into the growth models based on the previous findings due to the small sample sizes (Study 1: N = 64 with intervention = 23; Study 2: N = 42 with intervention = 20).
Study 1: Targeted intervention
In this study, we included condition, gender, and grade to explain the variation of the intercept and only condition to explain the variation of growth rates. Table 4 showed that the model fit was not improved after including the explanatory variables. No condition, gender or grade differences were found on the parameters of either the intercept or two growth rates.

HLM software does not provide significance tests for the level-1 within-person random effect, so the value of standard deviation (SD) is provided in the table.
Similar to results from the full sample in Study 1, children had a faster rate of drop on anxiety levels in the first 2.5 months and slower rate of decrease over the next 14.5 months. The EMM tests showed a statistically significant drop on the anxiety levels of this subgroup over time except Time-2–Time-3 (Table 3) with a larger magnitude compared to the mean differences obtained using the full sample.
Study 2: Universal intervention
In this study, we included condition, gender and grade to explain the variation of the intercept, and only condition to explain the variation of growth rate (2). The model fit was not improved after including the explanatory variables. In contrast to the other findings, a significant difference was found for condition on initial status, β01 = 5.055, p < .05 (Table 4). However, the treatment effect became statistically insignificant when using multiply imputed datasets. Because the sample size for the subgroup was small, the parameter estimates may not be stable with missing values. In addition, the improvement of model fit indices was not statistically significant after including the predictors. Hence, it is not appropriate to treat this as an indicator of a significant treatment effect.

Discussion
The present studies evaluated the effectiveness of the CBT curriculum, FRIENDS, in two large Canadian public elementary school districts using random assignment at the school-level and an attention-control design for both targeted (Study 1) and universal (Study 2) intervention settings. Contrary to our hypotheses, overall results from both studies showed no intervention effect, with children in both attention-control and intervention groups having similar patterns of anxiety reduction over time. No differences were found between the two condition groups across all analyses and across both targeted and universal applications, indicating that the story telling was as effective as the FRIENDS program. We found that anxiety levels dropped at a faster rate in the first 2.5 months and then at a slower rate over the next 14.5 months for both intervention and attention-control groups. The same pattern was found for the high-anxiety subgroups of children.
In addition, girls were found to report more anxiety than boys, and children in higher grades reported lower levels of anxiety relative to those in the younger grades at Time-2 (initial status). Differences on gender and grade were not found for the high-anxiety subgroups at initial status. However, no gender or grade differences were found on the growth rates for all studies. Due to the small sample size of the highly anxious subgroup, the power of the significance tests is reduced, so generalizations from these findings are cautioned.
Although inconsistent with some research using the FRIENDS program (Barrett, 1998), these findings are consistent with other school-based investigations in which clinically effective interventions, when transported to the classroom and compared with an alternate control condition, reveal no significance in effectiveness (specifically depression, conduct disorder, and substance abuse prevention; for review see Rones & Hoagwood, 2000). Conjecture as to why the clinical intervention, when delivered in a large group format by nonclinicians (e.g., teachers), did not outperform an alternative control condition is rich. Most obviously, the power of attention can be therapeutic (Deni, 2001, Jensen et al., 2005). Deni (2001) reviewed studies demonstrating that the “effectiveness of teacher attention alone in elementary classrooms can change behavior” (p. 409). While not specifically targeting anxiety, children in the reading condition may have felt included in the larger group, looked to Harry Potter as a role model, received a healthy dose of attention and relaxation during the reading hour, or enjoyed other nonspecific effects. Further research on understanding the therapeutic effects of attention and on disentangling the specific mechanisms of change is warranted.
These studies contribute to the growing body of research on school-based prevention and early intervention. The results illustrate the challenges involved in conducting school-based controlled trials as well as the importance of including active or placebo control conditions. Strengths of the study and those that increase generalizability of the results include large and heterogeneous sample sizes, random assignment of schools to conditions, inclusion of an attention-control group, use of a validated ‘best practice’ protocol, random audio integrity checks, use of school personnel in delivering the program, and the use of reliable and valid reporting measures across multiple informants.
Limitations of the studies include reliance on self-report measures. The BASC is a lengthy instrument and may have been difficult for parents and teachers to complete. Because of the low rate of return from both parents and teachers, we were unable to analyze data from parents and teachers in the present research. Second, despite a large sample recruited from our communities, many did not fit our criteria (e.g., did not have parent consent, did not have elevated anxiety for inclusion in targeted study). Due to the small sample sizes (i.e., a small number of schools/classrooms), the efficiency and power of significance tests in HLM may be reduced. Additionally, although the final samples represented a linguistically, ethnically, and economically diverse population of children from grades 4 to 6, as we could only include data from children with parental consent, specific barriers to consent are unknown (e.g., language difficulties), thus affecting the generalizability of our findings. Third, the one-day training may have been insufficient for competency with the intervention, despite training day trainee reports indicating feelings of self-confidence in delivering FRIENDS and the relatively high program adherence. Teacher characteristics such as experience, enthusiasm, and motivation may have influenced program participant learning (see Neil & Christensen, 2009, for discussion). The attention-control condition (storytelling) was presumably delivered with similar integrity, but this was not captured other than group facilitators reporting similar progress through the novel and positive student response.
The current studies augment the literature on school-based prevention research and have important implications on the transporting of clinically efficacious programming into schools. Although some research support exists for school-based prevention and intervention with emotional problems using the FRIENDS program (Barrett et al., 2006, Barrett and Turner, 2001, Lowry-Webster et al., 2001), experimental designs using attention-control conditions in schools have not been well investigated. Other studies on internalizing symptoms and disorders that utilize control groups in community settings have shown mixed results; perhaps it is something other than the CBT curriculum that is active such as attention, maturation, time, the group dynamic (e.g., finding out other children feel similarly) or other features that differentiate the conditions. Future studies would greatly benefit from the inclusion of not only attention-control and active intervention conditions, but also a pure and sustained control. Other anxiety prevention programs have found a delayed-intervention effect (e.g., Dadds et al., 1997); longitudinal studies with a longer time period are recommended.
With the growing emphasis on evidence-based practice and as more programs become institutionalized in schools, predictably more children should be identified earlier as suffering from anxiety and therefore possible candidates for more intensive services. While the scientific community has provided ample evidence of the utility of CBT approaches in clinical treatment, these services are offered to a minority of the school-based population, and knowledge of ‘what works’ in schools is less clear.

where Ytij denotes outcome at time t for child i in school/classroom j; π0ij is the intercept of the growth trajectory (i.e., expected outcome) for child i in j school/classroom at Time-2; π1ij is the growth rate between Time-1 and Time-2; π2ij is the growth rate between Time-2 and Time-4; β00j is the average of level-1 intercepts (i.e., the average expected outcome at Time-2); β10j and β20j are the average of growth rates in the 1st and 2nd periods respectively; all other βs are the regression coefficients for specific level-2 predictors and are fixed at level-3; γ000 is the overall mean of intercepts; γ100 and γ200 are the over mean of growth rates in the 1st and 2nd periods respectively; γ001 and γ101 are the regression coefficients for level-3 predictor “condition”; all other γs are the fixed regression coefficients for all level-2 predictors; etij is the level-1 residual; r0ij and r2ij are level-2 residuals for the intercept and growth rate(2); u00j and u10j are level-3 residuals for the intercept and growth rate(1).
Please note that although r1ij is not significant, we did not fix this residual to zero because we needed this residual variance to calculate the effect size for the targeted study. However, r1ij was fixed to zero in the universal study but because of the convergence problem, effect size was not able to be calculated.
