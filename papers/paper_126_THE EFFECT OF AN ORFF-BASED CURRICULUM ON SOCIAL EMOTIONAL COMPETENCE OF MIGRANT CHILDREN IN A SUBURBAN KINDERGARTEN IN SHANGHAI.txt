Abstract. The quasi-experimental design included students in two kindergarten classes, where one
class of 28 students was randomly assigned to receive the treatment while the other class of 28
served as the control group. The intervention was a 16-session Orff music curriculum over a period
of eight weeks, aimed at improving children’s social emotional competence. The results indicated
that, after participating in the Orff-based musical program, children in the treatment group were
rated significantly higher in responsibility, social competence and self regulation as compared to
children in the control group beyond that accounted for by the pretest scores and gender. No
statistically significant improvements in children’s empathy was found after participation in this
program.
Introduction
Orff Schulwerk is not only an effective way of teaching music for children and adolescents, but
also an approach to address non-musical goals in educational and clinical interventions. This study
adds to the research base by conducting an intervention for migrant children in a suburban school in
Shanghai to improve their social emotional competencies. In this current study, the aim is to
enhance the student participants’ emotional competency and social skills through receiving the
Orff-based curriculum. This study informs Chinese music educators and kindergarten teachers
regarding teaching strategies for improving children’s social competence in a new way of a
music-based curriculum.
Literature Review
Psychological Functions of Music
Evidence from many researches indicates there are underlying influences of music and music
education on non-musical capacities [5, 12, 15, 16]. This exploratory research provides some of the
first empirical data regarding the possible benefits of using an Orff-based curriculum to enhance
migrant children’s social emotional competence in the setting of a Chinese suburban school with
kindergarteners. The findings add to the research literature which focuses on the influence of Orff
Schulwerk on children’s social and psychological development and the non-musical functions of
musical activities. This inquiry informs Chinese music educators and kindergarten classroom
teachers regarding teaching strategies for improving children’s social emotional competence
through the use of a music-based curriculum.
These influences are not only related to musical accomplishment, but also associated with
psychological wellness. In ancient Greece, music education was so important that it was considered
as a basic discipline in education [2]. Several great philosophers considered music to impact human
emotion and cognition. Aristotle proposed that music could imitate emotion and character of
humans, such as gentleness, happiness, anger, sadness and braveness [6]. Both Aristotle and Plato
considered that exquisite music could make people graceful [19]. When people listen to and imitate
music with various emotional expressions, they may be filled with emotions of the same nature; if
999
and when exposed for a long time to music of base emotions, the receivers’ disposition might be
influenced that way [19].
A growing body of evidence indicates that music education or music intervention can be
considered as effective methods to enhance the social competence of children and adolescents [2,
9]. Music can express one’s emotions through the arrangement of notes and rhythm. As one
function of music is to influence people’s emotions, it is not a surprise to find music education can
have an impact on social development. Thoma, Scholz, Ehlert, and Nater, find that qualitative
aspects of music listening are significantly related to the psychological functioning, mediated by
emotion regulation and dispositional stress reactivity [20].
Orff Schulwerk
Orff Schulwerk (Schoolwork) is a music education approach for children, adolescents and adults
founded by Carl Orff (1895-1982), a German musician and music educator [17] (Shamrock, 1988).
Orff Schulwerk has a system of teaching strategies that include singing, movement, speech,
instrumental playing, and a series of textbooks for teaching music within elementary schools.
However, it does not require the direct use of textbooks in different countries. In fact, the utilization
of the Orff approach is encouraged for music educators, teachers, professors and composers to
develop their own materials from folk songs, instruments and other local resources under the big
“umbrella” of the idea “Elementar Musik” and teaching strategies [18]. Findings from research,
examining the effects of Orff-based musical curriculum and Orff-based musical therapy
intervention indicate improvement in children’s psychological well-being [4]. In addition, it is
found that employing the ideas from Orff Schulwerk has positive effects on children’s social
communication, self-efficacy, social skills and emotional regulation in South Korea [25].
Social Emotional Competence
The Ministry of Education in China issued the “Guide of Learning and Development for Children
from Three to Six” (“Guide”) in the year 2010. The expert panel in early childhood education spent
six years developing this “Guide” based on studying related policies from 13 countries and two
years of research. This research recruited approximately 3,600 children, their parents and their
teachers in China [14]. More detailed explanations and standards of every field are provided. It is
pointed out that the social development process of children from three to six years old is the basis
for improving their socialization and healthy personalities, mainly including interpersonal behaviors
and social adaptation identified in the “Guide.” Early childhood is the key period for social
development; good interpersonal and social adaptation have positive impacts on children’s physical
and mental health development, academic achievement and intellectual development. Engaging in
communication with adults and peers, children can learn not only how to get along with people, but
also how to see themselves, practice positive ways to treat others, and gain abilities to acquire skills
to adapt to social life [14].
Migrant Children
In China, migrant children are youth who are under 18 years old live in a town or suburban areas
without local household registration [7]. Under this binary system, schools in suburban areas are
facing two challenges: one is the shortage of qualified teachers; the other one is the high proportion
of migrant children [21, 22]. In Shanghai, the educationally advanced areas are mostly located in
urban districts; in contrast, suburban areas and districts show an obvious lack of quality educational
resources and services [21].
Furthermore, in Shanghai, four out of every 10 children are migrant children, and the proportion
is even higher in suburban schools [1]. It is reported that, although the number of migrant children
is increasing, their families encounter many economic, social welfare and social-cultural obstacles
that make it difficult for them to adapt to city life [8, 24]. There is growing evidence indicating that
migrant children in China, in general, suffer from different kinds of psychological problems. They
may have the risks of experiencing depression, separation anxiety, feelings of inferiority, and
1000
loneliness, and perform poorly in self regulation, adaptive behaviors, learning habits, and academic
achievement [3, 10, 11].
Because of the shortage of qualified teacher resources and the higher proportion of migrant
children in China’s large municipalities of millions of people, migrant children in suburban
kindergartens may have potential risks and challenges regarding their psychological wellness and
development. Therefore, there is a need to pay attention to young migrant children’s social
development and mental wellness [3, 10, 23]. However, few studies employ the strategies of Orff
Schulwerk as a framework aimed at improving children’s social emotional development in the
contexts of schools.
Research Questions
This present inquiry is designed to engage kindergarten students, from migrant families, in an
integrated curriculum using an Orff approach to study its influence on improving children’s social
emotional competencies in a suburban school in Shanghai, China.
Based on the literature review and the instrument employed, the research questions are as follow:
1. Does participation in the Orff-based musical curriculum improve migrant kindergarteners’
responsibility after controlling for gender and initial levels of responsibility?
2. Does participation in the Orff-based musical curriculum improve migrant kindergarteners’
social competence after controlling for gender and initial levels of social competence?
3. Does participation in the Orff-based musical curriculum improve migrant kindergarteners’ self
regulation after controlling for gender and initial levels of self regulation?
4. Does participation in the Orff-based musical curriculum improve migrant kindergarteners’
empathy after controlling for gender and initial levels of empathy?
Methodology
Two kindergarten classes with 28 children in each class, from five to six years of age, were to be
selected, wherein both of each class would be children of migrant workers. One class was to be
randomly assigned as the control group, with the other one serving as the treatment group. Each
class had two classroom teachers taking charge of their daily activities. When selecting the classes
of students, criteria related to teacher characteristics also were considered. Teachers needed to have
worked with the children for at least six months so that they would know them sufficiently well to
complete the data collection instrument pertaining to their students. In addition, the researcher tried
to select control and treatment group teachers who had similar educational training and work
experience. The sampling unit was the class but individual students served as the unit of statistical
analysis.

Teacher participants completed the Chinese version of teacher form of Social Emotional Assets
and Resilience Scales to provide their perspectives of their students’ social emotional competence.
1001
The teacher form of SEARS has four subscales: Self-regulation, responsibility, empathy and social
competence [13].
Children in the treatment group received this Orff-based curriculum twice a week. Each lesson was
completed in one week: the first class was spent teaching the new lesson and the second class of the
week reviewed the previous session. The schedule of the intervention and the assessment are shown
in Table 1.
Result
Table 2 shows the means and the standard deviations of responsibility, self regulation, social
competence and empathy of the pretest and posttest scores for each group. According to the results
of the independent-samples t-tests, using alpha = .05, there was evidence to suggest that the
responsibility posttest scores differ, on average, between the control group and the treatment, t(54)
= 2.080, p = .04. There was evidence to suggest that the social competence pretest scores differ, on
average, between the control group and the treatment, t(54) = -2.065, p = .04. There was evidence
to suggest that the self regulation pretest scores differ, on average, between the control group and
the treatment, t(54) = -3.346 , p = .001.There was evidence to suggest that the empathy pretest
scores differ, on average, between the control group and the treatment, t(54) = -2.552, p = .01.

Table 3 provides the correlations among the main variables, using pretest scores above and
posttest scores below the diagonal. As would be expected from the t-test results, as shown in the
correlations matrix, the condition and responsibility posttest scores were significantly correlated (p
< 0.05, two-tailed). Also, the four indicators of social emotional competence were highly correlated
before and after the intervention.
Research question one (RQ1) asked whether participation in an Orff based musical curriculum
improved migrant kindergarteners’ responsibility or not after controlling for gender and initial
levels of responsibility. A sequential multiple regression was conducted. In Model 1, the control
variable (gender) was entered along with the corresponding pretest (i.e., that measures initial levels
of responsibility). In Model 2, the condition (treatment, coded 1; control, coded 0) was added to the
Model 1 variables. As shown in Table 2, in Model 1, the control variable (gender) was entered
along with the corresponding pretest (i.e., that measures initial levels of responsibility); together,
the two variables explain almost 59.7% of the variance in posttest responsibility scores (see Table
20). In Model 2, the condition (treatment, coded 1; control, coded 0) was added to the Model 1
variables. Model 1 was statistically significant and the addition of knowing whether the student
participated in the treatment or not (condition) accounted for an additional 4.1% of the variance in
posttest scores of responsibility, ΔR2
 = .041, F (1, 52) = 5.862, p = .019. (Table 4).

Four multiple regressions were conducted and the results show that the intervention had positive
effects on students’ social emotional competency (specifically participants’ responsibility, social
competence and self regulation) after controlling for gender along with their initial levels of
responsibility, social competence and self regulation, respectively.
Discussion
The ability of children to perceive mood and feeling, and to understand their emotional status
provides a foundation for furthering their good social relations and prosocial behaviors. However,
the findings in this current study suggest that the Orff-based musical curriculum can improve
children’s empathy but not to a statistically significant extent. There are two reasons for this result,
one is the intervention is a short-term program, and the other one is that for children in the early
childhood, it may be more difficult to master and apply the skills of empathy than the other three
aspects of social emotional competence.
Recommendations on Further Studies
The design of the experiment can be also adjusted for different participants (both migrant and
local children) based on their levels of social emotional competence and characteristics. In addition,
future research studies might lengthen the intervention and collect delayed posttest scores to explore
the long term influence of the Orff-based curriculum, as studies in other countries tended to use
longer interventions.
Summary
 This exploratory research provides some of the first empirical data regarding the possible benefits
of using an Orff-based curriculum to enhance migrant children’s social emotional competence in
the setting of a Chinese suburban school with kindergarteners. The findings add to the research
literature which focuses on the influence of Orff Schulwerk on children’s social and psychological
development and the non-musical functions of musical activities. This inquiry informs Chinese
music educators and kindergarten classroom teachers regarding teaching strategies for improving
children’s social emotional competence through the use of a music-based curriculum
