The aim of this study was to analyse the intrinsic classroom satisfaction, physical self-concept and social goals in students in the 4th year of secondary school after receiving a 9 weeks' Adventure Education programme. The sample consisted of 125 students, divided into an experimental group ('n' = 76) and a control group ('n' = 49). The measuring instrument was a questionnaire consisting of Intrinsic Satisfaction Classroom Scale (ISC), Physical Self-Perception Questionnaire (PSQ) and Scale of Social Goals-Physical Education (SGS-PE). Measures were taken before (pretest) and after the intervention programme (post-test) for both groups. We undertook a multivariate analysis (MANOVA) 2×2 (Group × Time) in order to analyse the effects of the intervention programme. Significant differences were found in all nine dimensions analysed, particularly satisfaction/enjoyment, self-esteem and physical condition with highest rates of gain and the significant relationship between body image and physical condition.
