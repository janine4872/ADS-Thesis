Abstract
Bullying is a salient challenge for children and schools around the world, appearing to be especially prevalent at the middle-school level. Contemporary research reveals an exigent need for systematic programing that aims to reduce and prevent bullying via promoting awareness, attitudes, and skills that facilitate the development of positive peer relationships and positive school climates. Considering this need, the present quasi-experimental study examined the effects of a relatively new, brief, universal-level bullying prevention curriculum on middle-school students’ general attitudes toward bullying and perceptions of their school bullying supports. Results indicated statistically significant enhancement of prosocial attitudes for intervention-group students compared to control-group students, with small effect sizes. Feasibility and social validity outcomes indicated that the intervention was implemented with adequate fidelity and that its goals, procedures, and outcomes were perceived as appropriate. The interpretation, limitations, and implications of these results for practice are discussed herein.

Introduction
Given that most severe forms of aggression and victimization (e.g., assault with a weapon) take place in the home and other community settings, schools are often considered one of the safest places for youth (Jimerson, Morrison, Pletcher, & Fulrong, 2006). Nevertheless, given the amount of mildly aggressive acts perpetrated on campus, schools have also been conceptualized as epicenters for lower-level, non-severe violence (e.g., verbal harassment; Furlong, Pavelski, & Saxton, 2002). Among these less-severe-yet-more-common forms of violence perpetrated at school, bullying has received increasing attention during the past decade, as it is becoming more prevalent, is associated with a host of deleterious outcomes for students and school climates, and is posited to serve as a developmental pathway toward more severe forms of antisocial behavior (Spivak & Prothrow-Stith, 2001). In response, researchers from various disciplines have undertaken bullying scholarship in an attempt to better understand the nature of the phenomenon and to develop interventions that mitigate its negative effects on youth and schools (e.g., Espelage & Swearer, 2004; Jimerson, Swearer, & Espelage, 2010).
Bullying is generally operationalized as a three-dimensional construct: an (1) intentional, malicious form of victimization that (2) occurs repeatedly over time (3) between parties wherein there exists a relative power differential (Olweus, 2010). Students may participate in bullying relationships via several roles: as bullies, victims, bully-victims, and bystanders (Alsaker and Gutzwiller-Helfenfinger 2010). To date, each of these participatory roles has been identified in every nation that has undertaken a descriptive study of this three-dimensional construct, suggesting that bullying is problematic for students and schools around the world (Jimerson et al., 2010). For example, within the United States alone, it is estimated that around 30% of students in sixth through tenth grades are involved in bullying—either as a bully, victim, or both (Nansel et al., 2001). Moreover, within the past decade, several initiatives studying bullying from a cross-cultural perspective continue to reveal increasing prevalence rates within both Western and Eastern nations (e.g., Murray-Harvey, Slee, & Taki, 2010). Such international studies indicate that school bullying in all countries, including the United States, is highly associated with pervasive, negative school climate effects, including an environment characterized by increased interpersonal tension and intimidation as well as decreased school connectedness and academic engagement (e.g., Kosciw, Greytak, Diaz, & Bartkiewicz, 2010).
Beyond elevated prevalence rates, both national and cross-national studies reveal that bullying is highly associated with deleterious physical, social, educational, and psychological outcomes for victims, perpetrators, and bystanders. Specifically, being bullied has been shown to be related to enhanced likelihood for acquiring generalized and socialized anxiety, depression, loneliness, posttraumatic stress, low self-esteem and self-competence, poor school adjustment and academic performance, poor physical health, self-perceived unpopularity, externalizing problem behaviors (e.g., intentional rule-breaking), and attention difficulties (Dioguardi & Theodore, 2006). Moreover, in a review of research investigating the negative correlates for all parties involved in bullying (Swearer, Grills, Haye, & Cary, 2004), several noteworthy psychosocial outcome trends were highlighted: (a) both bullies and victims report lower levels of self-esteem than uninvolved students; (b) bully-victims report lower levels of self-esteem than all other involved parties; (c) youth involved in bullying more frequently, no matter what their role, report lower self-esteem than those who are involved less often; (d) depression is highly associated with all roles in the bullying process, with bully-victims showing the highest levels; (e) bully-victims are the most at-risk for suicide of all involved parties; and (f) victims and bully-victims manifest greater general anxiety than bullies and uninvolved parties. Taken together, these data suggest that bullying involvement at any level is associated with deleterious psychosocial outcomes, while bully-victims are at the highest risk for mental health problems.
Given the negative effects of bullying on school climates and youth’s well-being, a large portion of bullying scholarship has focused on evaluating the effectiveness of systematic prevention and intervention efforts employed within school settings. Although all bullying prevention programs share a similar overarching aim—namely, reducing bullying behavior—they seek to accomplish this aim via different means. For example, some programs focus on identifying, targeting, and remediating bullies, while others focus on identifying and empowering victims or bystanders; some focus on improving the social skills of all students, while others focus primarily on changing the school culture and environment. Within the past 5 years, several meta-analyses have synthesized the national and international state-of-the-art surrounding these efforts. Taken together, these studies have indicated mixed findings, suggesting that, overall, bullying prevention and intervention efforts may have negligible to strong effects on student outcomes, depending on what indicators are being evaluated. For example, Smith, Schneider, Smith and Ananiadou (2004) reported negligible effects for both self-reported victimization and perpetration outcomes, while Ttofi, Farrington and Baldry (2008) reported large, positive effects for observed bullying and self-reported emotional and attitudinal outcomes. Yet another meta-analysis, conducted by Merrell, Guelder, Ross and Isava (2008), reported small to moderate, positive effects for attitudinal outcomes but primarily negligible effects for behavioral outcomes.
Although the types of bullying interventions evaluated in these meta-analyses seek to reduce bullying via different means, and although there is little agreement among professionals regarding the best approach for effectively preventing bullying (Rigby & Bauman, 2010), a review of the most popular intervention programs suggests that current prevention efforts—and thus those evaluated within the meta-analyses described above—tend to share several core administrative characteristics: large-scale year-to-multiyear implementation periods, general resource intensiveness (i.e., constant assistance from extra-school support stuff and substantial training needed for local educators), a school-ecology intervention approach (i.e., involving individual, classroom, and schoolwide components, which target staff, student, and policy changes), and an orientation toward antisocial behavior and attitude reduction (Jimerson & Huai, 2010). Given this administrative homogeneity among bullying prevention programs, and considering the mixed effectiveness of such efforts to date, there appears to be a substantial warrant for the development and evaluation of different kinds of bullying interventions, including those characterized by smaller-scale and briefer implementation periods, lower resource intensiveness (e.g., little involvement from outside support staff as well as little training requirements), reduced and isolated intervention components (e.g., classroom-only efforts), and an orientation toward prosocial behavior and attitude development. In addition, there is also a warrant for the development and evaluation of bullying interventions that are informed by contemporary research regarding the core characteristics of effective prevention programs.
As a result of the mixed effectiveness of bullying interventions, much scholarship has also been devoted to identifying the core characteristics of successful bullying prevention programing. But similar to the meta-analyses, empirical studies in this area have also revealed differing findings. For instance, Ttofi et al. (2008) noted eight core components associated with programs that demonstrated effective reductions in reported bullying behavior: parent training, improved playground supervision, enhanced disciplinary methods, frequent school conferences, provision of information for parents, enhanced classroom rules, improved classroom management, and inclusion of video-based instructional materials—and five core components associated with programs that demonstrated effective reductions in reported victimization experiences: enhanced disciplinary methods, initiated work with peers, parent training, cooperative group work, and improved playground supervision. Moreover, Rigby (2006) observed that effective bullying interventions are typically comprised of at least three core components: the development of universal-level antibullying policies; the integration of a social-cognitive classroom curriculum to raise awareness of bullying, promote prosocial attitudes, and teach social-emotional learning skills; and the establishment of procedures for handling bullying incidences at school. Furthermore, Hazler and Carney (2006) concluded that the most effective bullying interventions seem to share several characteristics: enhancing the empathic involvement of students, increasing school connectedness, raising awareness regarding bullying and its deleterious effects, establishing anti-bullying school policies, and developing student social skills.
In addition to centering the development and implementation of interventions around the characteristics of effective bullying programs (described above), scholars also acknowledge that consideration of contextual and feasibility elements—which are typically ignored in studies identifying effective program characteristics—is equally important, as striking a balance between empirical rigor and social validity is necessary to promote the sustainability of bullying interventions at the local site level (Larson & Busse, 2006). To date, as noted above, the most widely used bullying interventions are characterized by administrative characteristics that are likely to negatively impact social validity. Specifically, large-scale, multi-year, resource-intensive, multicomponent prevention efforts are likely to tax the motivation of school personnel and diminish the overall implementation fidelity of the intervention. This is especially likely in school contexts wherein substantial extra-school resources, such as monetary support and additional administrative personnel, are limited or absent. Therefore, in addition to research evaluating empirically promising interventions that are grounded in contemporary theory and evidence, there is also a substantial warrant for research evaluating the social validity and feasibility of these efforts (Olweus, 2010). Without this sort of scholarship, the literature will remain ambiguous regarding the capacity of school personnel to effectively sustain effective bullying prevention programing at the local site level, without the assistance of significant extra-school resources. Such local sustainability seems necessary if bullying prevention is ever to take root as a core component of educators’ practice and schools’ curriculum.
Beyond the social validity and feasibility of bullying interventions, there is another conspicuous characteristic that has yet to receive much empirical attention: dosage-response effects (Merrell et al., 2008). In the greater world of educational research, dosage-response effects have been frequently investigated and demonstrated to be a significant moderator of intervention effectiveness. For example, several studies show that measures of cognitive and academic achievement increase as intervention duration increases (e.g., Breit-Smith, Justice, McGinty, & Kaderavek, 2009), while other studies indicate that increased intervention duration is significantly associated with increased positive behavioral outcomes in the classroom and other school-based settings (e.g., Zelezny, 1999). Furthermore, educational scholarship demonstrates that the maintenance of positive academic and behavioral outcomes is also significantly moderated by the original intervention duration (e.g., Reynolds, Temple, Robertson, & Mann, 2001). Generalizing from these and similar findings, it seems reasonable that intervention duration may be a key moderating characteristic of the effectiveness of bullying prevention programing. So far, however, most studies reporting on bullying prevention span long intervention durations—ranging from 1 year to multiple years—while other educational interventions, such as those described above, are typically characterized by multi-week to multi-month durations. Moreover, there is no evidence to indicate that bullying interventions need to be this long, nor that briefer interventions (i.e., multi-week to multi-month) may not be just as effective. In fact, given the strain on resources and social validity that can accompany long-term programing efforts, and recognizing the mixed findings currently yielded by efforts of this nature, there appears to be a substantial warrant for investigating the influence of dosage-response effects on the utility of briefer bullying interventions in school settings.
That said, the purpose of the present study was to further bullying intervention scholarship by investigating the initial effects of a relatively new, brief, empirically promising, universal-level antibullying curriculum: Promoting Positive Peer Relationships (P3R; Faull, Swearer, Jimerson, Espelage, & Ng, 2008). P3R is grounded in a transactional-ecological model of youth’s development, which views all behavior, including antisocial acts such as bullying, within a functional-contextual framework—where habits of action are engaged and maintained because they help youth better adapt to their environments (Sameroff, 2000). Working from this theoretical perspective, P3R seeks to alter youth’s developmental trajectories toward more adaptive and healthier outcomes by raising awareness regarding bullying-related issues and promoting prosocial cognitive-behavioral habits (Faull et al., 2008). Unlike the majority of current universal-level bullying interventions, P3R is amenable to implementation within smaller-scale and briefer implementation periods (i.e., 5 weeks to 2 months), is characterized by low-resource intensiveness (i.e., requires little involvement from outside support staff as well as little training and support materials), is amenable to investigation of isolated intervention components (i.e., classroom-based intervention only), and is characterized by an orientation toward prosocial behavior and attitude development (i.e., cultivation of knowledge, empathy, and problem-solving skills). Considering the various areas of warranted investigation within bullying prevention research (as noted above), the present study aimed to evaluate more than just general intervention efficacy—extending the inquiry to target dosage-response effects and social validity considerations. Specifically, the following research questions were investigated by utilizing P3R within a junior-high school context:
1.
Is P3R a feasible and socially valid intervention when used within a general education classroom and implemented by a general education teacher?
2.
Is P3R an effective intervention for enhancing students’ general attitudes toward bullying as well as their perceptions of their school’s bullying supports?
3.
Does the implementation duration of P3R (i.e., 1-, 5-, and 8-week iterations) have dosage-response effects on students’ attitudinal outcomes?

Method
School Context and Participants
The public junior-high school targeted in this study was located on the south-central coast of California, near a public university with which both of the authors were affiliated. During the beginning of the academic school year in which the study was conducted, the administration of the junior-high school and the two authors formed an applied research partnership. The administration noted that the school was experiencing increased bullying-related behavior, as evidenced by the nature of rising disciplinary referrals, and requested that the two authors help facilitate an appropriate schoolwide intervention. The authors agreed to provide the school with the necessary resources to implement and evaluate P3R during the coming year, given that the administration allowed the authors to use the de-identified data for research purposes. Therefore, during the year in which the study was conducted, the junior-high school adopted P3R as a mandatory element of the exploratory Health class taken by all seventh-grade students. Thus, all intervention-group students were seventh-graders who received the curriculum as part of their exploratory Health class curriculum during one of three trimesters (i.e., fall, winter, or spring), while all control-group students were 8th graders enrolled in alternative elective courses during the same trimesters.
Given this school context, all participants attended the same public junior-high school described above. The total sample was comprised of 636 seventh-grade and eighth-grade students, of which 320 were in the intervention group and 316 were in the control group. Although the entire student population was targeted as part of either the intervention group or the control group, only data from approximately 75% of student body were used herein—due to unusable data resulting from failure to complete surveys, incomplete survey responses, or questionable survey response patterns. As part of this study, demographics for each participating student were not collected; however, given that the majority of the school’s students participated in the study and that no particular demographics were biased through participant selection, schoolwide demographics were deemed to be an appropriate proxy measure. At the time of this study, then, 46% of the student population at this particular school were identified as White, 40% as Hispanic or Latino, 6% as Asian, 2% as African American, and 6% as multiple or other ethnicities. Furthermore, 31% of students were classified as socioeconomically disadvantaged—as evidenced by their qualification for free or reduced-price lunch—16% as English-language learners, and 15% as students with disabilities. Demographics for participating students were assumed to be similar.
P3R Curriculum
P3R is comprised of a series of psychoeducational film-based resources for supporting students, educators, and the surrounding community in addressing the problem of bullying in schools. The full curriculum is comprised of three separate yet interrelated programs—including classroom, professional development, and community education resources—that can be used in tandem or in isolation. Development of these resources was a multiyear project resulting from the collaborative efforts of a professional film director and a team of academic school psychologists (of which the second author was a member), who were guided by empirical literature, best practices, and consultative feedback from various students, teachers, school administrators, parents, and other child-service providers from across the United States (Faull et al., 2008). Given that P3R was created specifically for school-based use, its program features are designed to be feasibly implemented within school settings by either school-based mental health professionals (e.g., school psychologists) or educators (e.g., general and special education teachers). Since the public release of P3R in 2008, several small-scale empirical studies have been undertaken in various locations around the United States to evaluate the effects of the intervention on various students’, parents’, and educators’ bullying-related attitudes (e.g., empathy toward victims) and behaviors (e.g., bullying perpetration). To date, however, none of these studies have been published in professional journals; therefore, there are no public results available regarding the preliminary effects of P3R. (For more comprehensive information regarding P3R and its development, see www.storiesofus.com.)
Although P3R is a multicomponent and ecologically oriented intervention, the present study examined only the effects of the Classroom Resource on middle-school students’ prosocial attitudes. The limited scope of this investigation was constrained by practical considerations, as the P3R Classroom Resource is the only schoolwide intervention component and, at the time of the study, there were not enough human resources available to sponsor robust implementations of the other P3R component programs. The P3R Classroom Resource is an intervention comprised of lessons designed to be implementable by educators and flexibly integrated within classroom structures and schedules. Each lesson is planned to last approximately 30–50 min and is accompanied by the P3R Teacher’s Guide (Faull et al., 2008), which is a standardized, semi-scripted curriculum that serves to structure each lesson implementation. For each lesson, this guide provides the teacher with a bullet-pointed outline of the lesson’s core objectives, the materials needed to conduct the lesson, and a detailed overview of the various classroom activities to be carried out during the lesson.
All P3R lessons follow the same basic pedagogical format, consisting of a few core components: (a) viewing film segments portraying the initiation and development of bullying relationships for one male and one female victim within a middle-school context; (b) facilitating class discussions regarding these film segments—considering the students’ interpersonal relationship dynamics, identifying and working through related emotions, and employing group problem-solving strategies to develop positive behavioral solutions; and (c) providing psychoeducational information before, during, and following class activities to inform students of current school policy as well as supports available to assist them in handling bullying situations in a prosocial manner (e.g., seeking mediation via local school administrators or counselors). Taken together, these lessons provide youth with opportunities to cultivate greater empathic responsiveness and prosocial cognitive-behavioral habits by, first, exposing them to realistic portrayals of bullying and its deleterious effects; second, facilitating a safe space for students to explore their emotional, cognitive, and behavioral reactions to these portrayals as well as their real-life experiences; and, third, providing guidance and supervision for students as they work individually and collectively to synthesize their emotional, cognitive, and behavioral experiences into prosocial responses that can be enacted in the real-world. In this way, the Classroom Resource lessons facilitate the development of empathy and positive cognitive-behavioral habits through a combination of semi-structured reflective (i.e., past oriented), experiential (i.e., present oriented), and forward-looking (i.e., future oriented) activities that compel students to confront and engage their emotions, cognitions, and behavior. To compliment the classroom activities, each lesson is accompanied by suggestions for optional homework assignments (none of which were employed in the present study). Moreover, the P3R Teacher’s Guide contains both five-lesson-plan and eight-lesson-plan versions of the curriculum, allowing for more or less intensive implementations, depending on need and context.
The P3R Classroom Resource is grounded in a transactional-ecological model of youth’s development of antisocial behavior, which views student development within a contextual framework wherein all behaviors, including negative ones, serve a functional purpose for the individual—helping one better adapt to one’s environment (Sameroff, 2000). The transactional-ecological model recognizes that youth development is a complex process, comprised of macroregulations (i.e., environmental changes during key developmental periods), miniregulations (i.e., daily interactions between the child and her caregivers, siblings, or peers, which shape the development of behavior), and microregulations (i.e., brief interactions between the child and caregiver during which their responses are in sync; Sameroff, 1995). Given that this model emphasizes the dynamic nature of development, “children are not viewed as sponges, merely soaking up information, but rather as individuals who give and receive information that subsequently influences future developmental opportunities” (Jimerson et al., 2006, p. 10). Thus, there is a reciprocal relationship between children and contexts: contexts shape their behaviors and, in turn, their behaviors reshape those contexts (Sameroff, 2009). Grounded in a transactional-ecological perspective, the P3R Classroom Resource aims to raise students’ awareness regarding the functional nature of bullying-related behaviors, how those behaviors are shaped by youth’s contexts, and how they negatively impact their and other’s well-being. In addition to establishing such awareness, as mentioned above, the Classroom Resource also provides youth with opportunities to develop empathy and cognitive-behavioral skills that serve to prevent bullying-related behavior, promote prosocial behaviors, and therefore enhance the well-being of all students (Faull et al., 2008). Thus, by promoting positive internal and external actions, the Classroom Resource aims to alter youth’s developmental trajectories toward more adaptive and healthier outcomes.
Viewed in light of the scholarship regarding key characteristics of effective bullying prevention programs (discussed above), P3R’s program features appear promising. In particular, P3R’s film segments, class discussions, and pscyhoeducational elements are designed to promote the empathic involvement of students and emphasize the importance of school connectedness (cf. Hazler & Carney, 2006), include cooperative groupwork elements that aim to empower students with social problem-solving skills (cf. Rigby, 2006), and provide engaging opportunities for students to learn via an interactive, video-based medium (cf. Ttofi et al., 2008). However, it is noteworthy that overarching intention of P3R is fundamentally different from the majority of other current bullying prevention programs on the market. While other programs seek to directly and immediately reduce the prevalence of bullying behavior and victimization present within a school, P3R aims to raise awareness, enhance knowledge, and improve attitudes that are likely to facilitate more positive peer relationships and increased well-being at school. This scope appears both appropriate and reasonable in light of previous findings regarding the effectiveness and potential effects of bullying programing (e.g., Merrell et al., 2008) as well as developmental considerations regarding children’s cognitive and behavioral maturation (Jimerson et al., 2010).
Research Design and Variables
The questions and associated hypotheses of this study were investigated via a quasi-experimental, pretest–posttest research design, in which the seventh-graders in the Health classes served as the intervention group (n = 320) and the eighth-graders in the other elective courses served as the control group (n = 316). Overall, the study was designed to test one main effect as well as one interaction effect: the main effect of Group (i.e., intervention vs. control status) and the interaction effect of Group × Duration (i.e., 1-week vs. 5-week vs. 8-week implementation iterations, as a function of group status). Thus, P3R and its various duration iterations were conceptualized as the independent variables, while two attitudinal outcomes were conceptualized as the dependent variables: students’ general attitudes toward bullying and their perceptions of school bullying supports. Intervention feasibility and teacher perceptions of social validity were also conceptualized as independent variables; however, these outcomes were linked with the teacher, not the students, and were therefore only evaluated descriptively.
Measures
Bullying Attitudinal Scale: Short Form
The Bullying Attitudinal Scale (Song, Swearer, Haye, & Bandalos, 2001) is one of the few existing measures for assessing student attitudes related to bullying. It is comprised of 14 items arranged on a five-point Likert scale (i.e., “totally false” to “totally true”) and is scored by summing the responses to produce a composite score, with higher scores indicating more prosocial attitudes toward bullying. At the time of the present study, limited psychometric support for this measure was available, with only two studies reporting acceptable levels of internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .71 and .78) and only one study reporting a moderate, 1-year test–retest reliability coefficient (r = .54; Song et al.). Given the sparse psychometric data, and considering that the BAS had yet to be used for evaluating attitudinal change in response to intervention, the scale was descriptively analyzed for problematic items. As a result of this critical review, seven of the BAS items were deemed to be potentially problematic, as they did not appear to measure prosocial attitudinal change and therefore could not be expected to have an optimal response (e.g., “I would be friends with a bully”). Thus, these seven items were deemed inappropriate for the purposes of the present study and were selected out, while the seven remaining items were retained and used as a single, short-form measure: the Bullying Attitudinal Scale: Short Form (BAS-SF).
Perceptions of School Bullying Supports Scale
Prior to this study, there were no available measures for assessing students’ perceptions of their local school bullying supports, a construct conceptualized as a proxy for school climate regarding bullying issues. Thus, for the purposes of this study, a brief 4-item measure was developed by the authors to assess this particular construct: the Perceptions of School Bullying Supports Scale (PSBSS). The few items comprising the PSBSS were designed to have practical utility and face validity for evaluating the underlying construct of student perceptions of school bullying supports (i.e., perceptions of efforts, policies, and relationships). Similar to the BAS-SF, each item was arranged on the same five-point Likert scale, and the responses were summed to produce a composite score, with higher scores indicating more positive perceptions of local school climate regarding bullying. No pilot testing was conducted with this measure prior to its use in the present study.
P3R Implementation Fidelity Checklists
The P3R Implementation Fidelity Checklists (P3R-IFC) were created by the authors for the present study to assess the Health teacher’s implementation fidelity of P3R and to serve as a proxy for intervention feasibility. Because different lesson plan versions were implemented during different trimesters, separate checklists were created for both the five-lesson and eight-lesson versions. One checklist was developed per lesson, consisting of brief restatements of the briefing procedures, lesson activity components, and debriefing components—summarized directly from the P3R Teacher’s Guide (Faull et al., 2008). Directions on each checklist instructed raters to mark “X” if the procedure or component was observed during the intervention session and “O” if the procedure or component was not observed.
Intervention Rating Profile for Teachers: P3R Adaptation
Intervention social validity has generally been conceptualized as a threefold evaluation of the social significance of the goals, social appropriateness and feasibility of the procedures, and social importance of the outcomes of an intervention, as perceived by its consumers (i.e., implementers or clients; Wolf, 1978). Given that P3R is a universal, social-cognitive intervention targeting groups of students, none of the currently available self-report social validity measures were deemed appropriate for assessing its social validity. Thus, the Intervention Rating Profile for Teachers, which has been deemed to have high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .91) and one primary factor loading (15-item loadings ranging from .82 to .95; Martens, Witt, Elliot, & Darveaux, 1985), was modified by the authors for use in the present study. The scale’s original 6-point Likert rating scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree,” was maintained, but item wording was altered to align with the aims of the P3R program (i.e., focus on attitudinal as opposed to behavioral changes.) This new, modified measure was called the Intervention Rating Profile for Teachers: P3R Adaptation (IRP-P3R).
P3R Social Validity Questionnaire
To provide a more robust assessment of social validity, the P3R Social Validity Questionnaire (P3R-SVQ) was created by the authors to assess the Health teacher’s perceptions of the goals, procedures, and outcomes of the P3R implementations. Specifically, the questionnaire was comprised of eight open-ended questions that surveyed the teacher’s perceptions of (a) the need for bullying intervention for the target students, (b) the feasibility of intervention procedures and durations, (c) the outcomes produced by the interventions, and (d) her general compliments and criticisms regarding the various intervention implementations as well as the overall P3R intervention.
Intervention and Data Collection Procedures
Given that the P3R Classroom Resource was officially adopted by the school’s administration as a mandatory part of the exploratory Health class curriculum, the administration chose to test three different iterations of the intervention—one during each trimester—to see whether one proved more effective than another, and thus to inform their future usage of the curriculum. Such iteration testing was amenable to the design of the Classroom Resource, as the curriculum included two different lesson plan versions within the Teacher’s Guide, both of which could be implemented via various durations. The administration and the authors decided, therefore, that the 5-lesson plan version would be implemented during a 1-week duration, followed by 5-lesson plan implementation during a 5-week duration, and concluding with an 8-lesson plan implementation during an 8-week duration. This implementation schedule would provide data on the comparative effectiveness of approximately 1-week, 1-month, and 2-month P3R interventions, respectively, and would run throughout the academic school year.
During the fall trimester of 2008, the five-lesson plan version of P3R was implemented in the exploratory Health course, which consisted of four class periods comprised of 22–28 students each (n = 107). One lesson was administered per day, Monday through Friday, and therefore the entire intervention was completed within 1 week. Following, during the winter trimester, the five-lesson plan version of P3R was again implemented in the exploratory Health course, with similar class sizes (n = 113). This time, however, only one lesson was administered per week, and thus the entire intervention was completed within 5 weeks. Finally, during the spring trimester, the eight-lesson plan version of P3R was implemented in the exploratory Health course, again with similar class sizes (n = 100). Similar to the previous trimester, one lesson was administered per week, and therefore the intervention was completed in 8 weeks. Control-group students (n = 105, 108, and 103 for the fall, winter, and spring trimesters, respectively) received “treatment as usual” during the same time periods in their exploratory elective courses. During each of these P3R Classroom Resource implementations, the Health teacher facilitated the intervention using the Teacher’s Guide (described above). Prior to each trimester’s implementation, the first author met with the teacher, checked to see whether she was oriented to the correct section of the curriculum that would be administered during the present trimester and answered any questions regarding procedures or content. The teacher typically had few, if any, questions—reporting that the Teacher’s Guide was self-explanatory and comprehensible.
As previously described, the present study employed a quasi-experimental research design, with repeated-measures (i.e., pre-posttest) used to assess students’ general attitudes toward bullying and perceptions of their local school bullying supports. To accomplish this, all items from the BAS-SF and the PSBSS were combined into a single outcome measure—entitled Quick Questions About Bullying—that was administered to both control-group and intervention-group students the day prior to beginning the intervention (i.e., pretest) as well as the day following the completion of the intervention (i.e., posttest) during each trimester. The teacher of the exploratory Health class administered these assessments for the intervention-group students, while the teachers of the various elective courses administered these assessments for the control-group students. During the course of the study, the control-group elective courses consisted of art, keyboarding, and woodshop—none of which included curriculum related to social, emotional, or behavioral development in youth. To enhance administration fidelity of the surveys and prevent against confounding teacher effects, all teachers were provided with a one-page, scripted handout consisting of an administration protocol, which was reviewed with them by the first author. The teachers reported that they followed the protocol appropriately; however, no observational implementation fidelity was taken. For both pretest and posttest administrations, and across control and intervention groups, all students completed these assessments in less than 10 min. Following each test administration (i.e., pre and post) during each trimester, the assessments were retrieved from all participating teachers and entered into an electronic database.
To measure implementation fidelity and therefore feasibility of the P3R, the Health teacher was provided with the appropriate P3R-IFC for each implementation, depending on the duration (i.e., 5-lesson or 8-lesson versions), and completed self-ratings immediately following each intervention session. Given that four classes received the intervention each trimester, the teacher completed 20 checklists the first trimester (for five lessons), 20 more the second trimester (for five lessons), and 32 the last trimester (for eight lessons)—resulting in a total of 72 self-completed fidelity checklists. To enhance the validity of the teacher’s self-reports, the first author conducted implementation fidelity observations using the P3R-IFC for approximately 25% of the intervention lessons during each trimester. Moreover, following the conclusion of all interventions, the Health teacher completed the IRP-P3R and the P3R-SVQ.
Data Analyses
Preliminary Analyses
Given that the BAS-SF and PSBSS were original with this study, preliminary analyses were conducted to explore their initial psychometric properties, using a subsample of 105 students from the first-trimester control group. One-week test–retest reliability was assessed for each of the seven items comprising the BAS-SF and each of the four items comprising the PSBSS, to ensure that the items amassing both composites were tenable. Following, test–retest reliability was also assessed for the BAS-SF and PSBSS composites. Internal consistency analyses were also conducted for the items comprising each measure, to ensure that it represented a unified underlying construct. Finally, to further confirm the reliability results, exploratory factor analyses—employing the Maximum Likelihood extraction method with a Promax (oblique) rotation—were conducted to determine the statistical dimensionality of both measures.
Beyond these analyses, the appropriateness of the projected usage of two-way factorial ANCOVA for some of the primary analyses was investigated by checking the assumptions for this particular analysis against the parameters of the current data set. Also, given that two separate ANCOVA analyses were projected, a Bonferonni’s adjustment was performed to prevent inflation of family-wise error, and power analyses were carried out to ascertain whether sufficient power would be obtained to identify statistically significant effects, if present.
Primary Analyses
The primary analyses of this study were conducted to investigate the three aforementioned research questions. Implementation fidelity for each intervention iteration was assessed via a two-stage quantitative descriptive analysis: first, fidelity for each lesson was assessed via summing the number of implemented components and dividing that by the total number of components per lesson, resulting in a percentage; second, a fidelity subtotal for each iteration implementation was ascertained and reported by summing all of the resulting percentages from each lesson within each duration iteration and then determining the mean percentage for each. Moreover, teacher perceptions of social validity were assessed by quantitative and qualitative means: first, all responses to items on the IRP-P3R were summed to produce a composite score, which was then judged against an associated descriptor indicating a level of perceived social validity (e.g., composite score >75 = high social validity); second, a general qualitative descriptive analysis of the content of the teacher’s responses to the P3R-SVQ was used to provide evidence for or against positive perceptions of the goals, procedures, and outcomes of the three intervention iterations as well as the overall intervention.
To assess the general intervention efficacy as well as possible dosage-response effects on students’ general attitudes toward bullying, an ANCOVA was conducted using the BAS-SF pretest composite group means as a covariate (i.e., to neutralize any confounding variables that may have effected baseline reports between seventh- and eighth-graders or between students in the health class and those in the other exploratory classes), the BAS-SF posttest composite group means as a dependent variable, and the Group (i.e., control or intervention) and Duration (i.e., 1-, 5-, 8-week) statuses as the between-subjects fixed-factor independent variables. Specifically, a Group main effect and a Duration × Group interaction effect were evaluated for potentially statistically significant difference between BAS-SF posttest means, followed by a descriptive mean evaluation to confirm the directionality of any noted effect as well as an effect size analysis to determine the educational import of the effect. Similarly, to assess the general intervention efficacy as well as possible dosage-response effects on students’ perceptions of their school’s bullying supports, a separate ANCOVA was conducted using the PSBSS pretest composite group means as a covariate, the PSBSS posttest composite group means as a dependent variable, and the Group and Duration statuses as the between-subjects fixed-factor independent variables. Again, a Group main effect and a Duration × Group interaction effect were evaluated for potentially statistically significant difference between PSBSS posttest means, followed by a descriptive mean evaluation to confirm the directionality of any noted effect as well as an effect size analysis to determine the educational import of the effect.

Method

School Context and Participants
The public junior-high school targeted in this study was located on the south-central coast of California, near a public university with which both of the authors were affiliated. During the beginning of the academic school year in which the study was conducted, the administration of the junior-high school and the two authors formed an applied research partnership. The administration noted that the school was experiencing increased bullying-related behavior, as evidenced by the nature of rising disciplinary referrals, and requested that the two authors help facilitate an appropriate schoolwide intervention. The authors agreed to provide the school with the necessary resources to implement and evaluate P3R during the coming year, given that the administration allowed the authors to use the de-identified data for research purposes. Therefore, during the year in which the study was conducted, the junior-high school adopted P3R as a mandatory element of the exploratory Health class taken by all seventh-grade students. Thus, all intervention-group students were seventh-graders who received the curriculum as part of their exploratory Health class curriculum during one of three trimesters (i.e., fall, winter, or spring), while all control-group students were 8th graders enrolled in alternative elective courses during the same trimesters.
Given this school context, all participants attended the same public junior-high school described above. The total sample was comprised of 636 seventh-grade and eighth-grade students, of which 320 were in the intervention group and 316 were in the control group. Although the entire student population was targeted as part of either the intervention group or the control group, only data from approximately 75% of student body were used herein—due to unusable data resulting from failure to complete surveys, incomplete survey responses, or questionable survey response patterns. As part of this study, demographics for each participating student were not collected; however, given that the majority of the school’s students participated in the study and that no particular demographics were biased through participant selection, schoolwide demographics were deemed to be an appropriate proxy measure. At the time of this study, then, 46% of the student population at this particular school were identified as White, 40% as Hispanic or Latino, 6% as Asian, 2% as African American, and 6% as multiple or other ethnicities. Furthermore, 31% of students were classified as socioeconomically disadvantaged—as evidenced by their qualification for free or reduced-price lunch—16% as English-language learners, and 15% as students with disabilities. Demographics for participating students were assumed to be similar.
P3R Curriculum
P3R is comprised of a series of psychoeducational film-based resources for supporting students, educators, and the surrounding community in addressing the problem of bullying in schools. The full curriculum is comprised of three separate yet interrelated programs—including classroom, professional development, and community education resources—that can be used in tandem or in isolation. Development of these resources was a multiyear project resulting from the collaborative efforts of a professional film director and a team of academic school psychologists (of which the second author was a member), who were guided by empirical literature, best practices, and consultative feedback from various students, teachers, school administrators, parents, and other child-service providers from across the United States (Faull et al., 2008). Given that P3R was created specifically for school-based use, its program features are designed to be feasibly implemented within school settings by either school-based mental health professionals (e.g., school psychologists) or educators (e.g., general and special education teachers). Since the public release of P3R in 2008, several small-scale empirical studies have been undertaken in various locations around the United States to evaluate the effects of the intervention on various students’, parents’, and educators’ bullying-related attitudes (e.g., empathy toward victims) and behaviors (e.g., bullying perpetration). To date, however, none of these studies have been published in professional journals; therefore, there are no public results available regarding the preliminary effects of P3R. (For more comprehensive information regarding P3R and its development, see www.storiesofus.com.)
Although P3R is a multicomponent and ecologically oriented intervention, the present study examined only the effects of the Classroom Resource on middle-school students’ prosocial attitudes. The limited scope of this investigation was constrained by practical considerations, as the P3R Classroom Resource is the only schoolwide intervention component and, at the time of the study, there were not enough human resources available to sponsor robust implementations of the other P3R component programs. The P3R Classroom Resource is an intervention comprised of lessons designed to be implementable by educators and flexibly integrated within classroom structures and schedules. Each lesson is planned to last approximately 30–50 min and is accompanied by the P3R Teacher’s Guide (Faull et al., 2008), which is a standardized, semi-scripted curriculum that serves to structure each lesson implementation. For each lesson, this guide provides the teacher with a bullet-pointed outline of the lesson’s core objectives, the materials needed to conduct the lesson, and a detailed overview of the various classroom activities to be carried out during the lesson.
All P3R lessons follow the same basic pedagogical format, consisting of a few core components: (a) viewing film segments portraying the initiation and development of bullying relationships for one male and one female victim within a middle-school context; (b) facilitating class discussions regarding these film segments—considering the students’ interpersonal relationship dynamics, identifying and working through related emotions, and employing group problem-solving strategies to develop positive behavioral solutions; and (c) providing psychoeducational information before, during, and following class activities to inform students of current school policy as well as supports available to assist them in handling bullying situations in a prosocial manner (e.g., seeking mediation via local school administrators or counselors). Taken together, these lessons provide youth with opportunities to cultivate greater empathic responsiveness and prosocial cognitive-behavioral habits by, first, exposing them to realistic portrayals of bullying and its deleterious effects; second, facilitating a safe space for students to explore their emotional, cognitive, and behavioral reactions to these portrayals as well as their real-life experiences; and, third, providing guidance and supervision for students as they work individually and collectively to synthesize their emotional, cognitive, and behavioral experiences into prosocial responses that can be enacted in the real-world. In this way, the Classroom Resource lessons facilitate the development of empathy and positive cognitive-behavioral habits through a combination of semi-structured reflective (i.e., past oriented), experiential (i.e., present oriented), and forward-looking (i.e., future oriented) activities that compel students to confront and engage their emotions, cognitions, and behavior. To compliment the classroom activities, each lesson is accompanied by suggestions for optional homework assignments (none of which were employed in the present study). Moreover, the P3R Teacher’s Guide contains both five-lesson-plan and eight-lesson-plan versions of the curriculum, allowing for more or less intensive implementations, depending on need and context.
The P3R Classroom Resource is grounded in a transactional-ecological model of youth’s development of antisocial behavior, which views student development within a contextual framework wherein all behaviors, including negative ones, serve a functional purpose for the individual—helping one better adapt to one’s environment (Sameroff, 2000). The transactional-ecological model recognizes that youth development is a complex process, comprised of macroregulations (i.e., environmental changes during key developmental periods), miniregulations (i.e., daily interactions between the child and her caregivers, siblings, or peers, which shape the development of behavior), and microregulations (i.e., brief interactions between the child and caregiver during which their responses are in sync; Sameroff, 1995). Given that this model emphasizes the dynamic nature of development, “children are not viewed as sponges, merely soaking up information, but rather as individuals who give and receive information that subsequently influences future developmental opportunities” (Jimerson et al., 2006, p. 10). Thus, there is a reciprocal relationship between children and contexts: contexts shape their behaviors and, in turn, their behaviors reshape those contexts (Sameroff, 2009). Grounded in a transactional-ecological perspective, the P3R Classroom Resource aims to raise students’ awareness regarding the functional nature of bullying-related behaviors, how those behaviors are shaped by youth’s contexts, and how they negatively impact their and other’s well-being. In addition to establishing such awareness, as mentioned above, the Classroom Resource also provides youth with opportunities to develop empathy and cognitive-behavioral skills that serve to prevent bullying-related behavior, promote prosocial behaviors, and therefore enhance the well-being of all students (Faull et al., 2008). Thus, by promoting positive internal and external actions, the Classroom Resource aims to alter youth’s developmental trajectories toward more adaptive and healthier outcomes.
Viewed in light of the scholarship regarding key characteristics of effective bullying prevention programs (discussed above), P3R’s program features appear promising. In particular, P3R’s film segments, class discussions, and pscyhoeducational elements are designed to promote the empathic involvement of students and emphasize the importance of school connectedness (cf. Hazler & Carney, 2006), include cooperative groupwork elements that aim to empower students with social problem-solving skills (cf. Rigby, 2006), and provide engaging opportunities for students to learn via an interactive, video-based medium (cf. Ttofi et al., 2008). However, it is noteworthy that overarching intention of P3R is fundamentally different from the majority of other current bullying prevention programs on the market. While other programs seek to directly and immediately reduce the prevalence of bullying behavior and victimization present within a school, P3R aims to raise awareness, enhance knowledge, and improve attitudes that are likely to facilitate more positive peer relationships and increased well-being at school. This scope appears both appropriate and reasonable in light of previous findings regarding the effectiveness and potential effects of bullying programing (e.g., Merrell et al., 2008) as well as developmental considerations regarding children’s cognitive and behavioral maturation (Jimerson et al., 2010).
Research Design and Variables
The questions and associated hypotheses of this study were investigated via a quasi-experimental, pretest–posttest research design, in which the seventh-graders in the Health classes served as the intervention group (n = 320) and the eighth-graders in the other elective courses served as the control group (n = 316). Overall, the study was designed to test one main effect as well as one interaction effect: the main effect of Group (i.e., intervention vs. control status) and the interaction effect of Group × Duration (i.e., 1-week vs. 5-week vs. 8-week implementation iterations, as a function of group status). Thus, P3R and its various duration iterations were conceptualized as the independent variables, while two attitudinal outcomes were conceptualized as the dependent variables: students’ general attitudes toward bullying and their perceptions of school bullying supports. Intervention feasibility and teacher perceptions of social validity were also conceptualized as independent variables; however, these outcomes were linked with the teacher, not the students, and were therefore only evaluated descriptively.
Measures
Bullying Attitudinal Scale: Short Form
The Bullying Attitudinal Scale (Song, Swearer, Haye, & Bandalos, 2001) is one of the few existing measures for assessing student attitudes related to bullying. It is comprised of 14 items arranged on a five-point Likert scale (i.e., “totally false” to “totally true”) and is scored by summing the responses to produce a composite score, with higher scores indicating more prosocial attitudes toward bullying. At the time of the present study, limited psychometric support for this measure was available, with only two studies reporting acceptable levels of internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .71 and .78) and only one study reporting a moderate, 1-year test–retest reliability coefficient (r = .54; Song et al.). Given the sparse psychometric data, and considering that the BAS had yet to be used for evaluating attitudinal change in response to intervention, the scale was descriptively analyzed for problematic items. As a result of this critical review, seven of the BAS items were deemed to be potentially problematic, as they did not appear to measure prosocial attitudinal change and therefore could not be expected to have an optimal response (e.g., “I would be friends with a bully”). Thus, these seven items were deemed inappropriate for the purposes of the present study and were selected out, while the seven remaining items were retained and used as a single, short-form measure: the Bullying Attitudinal Scale: Short Form (BAS-SF).
Perceptions of School Bullying Supports Scale
Prior to this study, there were no available measures for assessing students’ perceptions of their local school bullying supports, a construct conceptualized as a proxy for school climate regarding bullying issues. Thus, for the purposes of this study, a brief 4-item measure was developed by the authors to assess this particular construct: the Perceptions of School Bullying Supports Scale (PSBSS). The few items comprising the PSBSS were designed to have practical utility and face validity for evaluating the underlying construct of student perceptions of school bullying supports (i.e., perceptions of efforts, policies, and relationships). Similar to the BAS-SF, each item was arranged on the same five-point Likert scale, and the responses were summed to produce a composite score, with higher scores indicating more positive perceptions of local school climate regarding bullying. No pilot testing was conducted with this measure prior to its use in the present study.
P3R Implementation Fidelity Checklists
The P3R Implementation Fidelity Checklists (P3R-IFC) were created by the authors for the present study to assess the Health teacher’s implementation fidelity of P3R and to serve as a proxy for intervention feasibility. Because different lesson plan versions were implemented during different trimesters, separate checklists were created for both the five-lesson and eight-lesson versions. One checklist was developed per lesson, consisting of brief restatements of the briefing procedures, lesson activity components, and debriefing components—summarized directly from the P3R Teacher’s Guide (Faull et al., 2008). Directions on each checklist instructed raters to mark “X” if the procedure or component was observed during the intervention session and “O” if the procedure or component was not observed.
Intervention Rating Profile for Teachers: P3R Adaptation
Intervention social validity has generally been conceptualized as a threefold evaluation of the social significance of the goals, social appropriateness and feasibility of the procedures, and social importance of the outcomes of an intervention, as perceived by its consumers (i.e., implementers or clients; Wolf, 1978). Given that P3R is a universal, social-cognitive intervention targeting groups of students, none of the currently available self-report social validity measures were deemed appropriate for assessing its social validity. Thus, the Intervention Rating Profile for Teachers, which has been deemed to have high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .91) and one primary factor loading (15-item loadings ranging from .82 to .95; Martens, Witt, Elliot, & Darveaux, 1985), was modified by the authors for use in the present study. The scale’s original 6-point Likert rating scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree,” was maintained, but item wording was altered to align with the aims of the P3R program (i.e., focus on attitudinal as opposed to behavioral changes.) This new, modified measure was called the Intervention Rating Profile for Teachers: P3R Adaptation (IRP-P3R).
P3R Social Validity Questionnaire
To provide a more robust assessment of social validity, the P3R Social Validity Questionnaire (P3R-SVQ) was created by the authors to assess the Health teacher’s perceptions of the goals, procedures, and outcomes of the P3R implementations. Specifically, the questionnaire was comprised of eight open-ended questions that surveyed the teacher’s perceptions of (a) the need for bullying intervention for the target students, (b) the feasibility of intervention procedures and durations, (c) the outcomes produced by the interventions, and (d) her general compliments and criticisms regarding the various intervention implementations as well as the overall P3R intervention.
Intervention and Data Collection Procedures
Given that the P3R Classroom Resource was officially adopted by the school’s administration as a mandatory part of the exploratory Health class curriculum, the administration chose to test three different iterations of the intervention—one during each trimester—to see whether one proved more effective than another, and thus to inform their future usage of the curriculum. Such iteration testing was amenable to the design of the Classroom Resource, as the curriculum included two different lesson plan versions within the Teacher’s Guide, both of which could be implemented via various durations. The administration and the authors decided, therefore, that the 5-lesson plan version would be implemented during a 1-week duration, followed by 5-lesson plan implementation during a 5-week duration, and concluding with an 8-lesson plan implementation during an 8-week duration. This implementation schedule would provide data on the comparative effectiveness of approximately 1-week, 1-month, and 2-month P3R interventions, respectively, and would run throughout the academic school year.
During the fall trimester of 2008, the five-lesson plan version of P3R was implemented in the exploratory Health course, which consisted of four class periods comprised of 22–28 students each (n = 107). One lesson was administered per day, Monday through Friday, and therefore the entire intervention was completed within 1 week. Following, during the winter trimester, the five-lesson plan version of P3R was again implemented in the exploratory Health course, with similar class sizes (n = 113). This time, however, only one lesson was administered per week, and thus the entire intervention was completed within 5 weeks. Finally, during the spring trimester, the eight-lesson plan version of P3R was implemented in the exploratory Health course, again with similar class sizes (n = 100). Similar to the previous trimester, one lesson was administered per week, and therefore the intervention was completed in 8 weeks. Control-group students (n = 105, 108, and 103 for the fall, winter, and spring trimesters, respectively) received “treatment as usual” during the same time periods in their exploratory elective courses. During each of these P3R Classroom Resource implementations, the Health teacher facilitated the intervention using the Teacher’s Guide (described above). Prior to each trimester’s implementation, the first author met with the teacher, checked to see whether she was oriented to the correct section of the curriculum that would be administered during the present trimester and answered any questions regarding procedures or content. The teacher typically had few, if any, questions—reporting that the Teacher’s Guide was self-explanatory and comprehensible.
As previously described, the present study employed a quasi-experimental research design, with repeated-measures (i.e., pre-posttest) used to assess students’ general attitudes toward bullying and perceptions of their local school bullying supports. To accomplish this, all items from the BAS-SF and the PSBSS were combined into a single outcome measure—entitled Quick Questions About Bullying—that was administered to both control-group and intervention-group students the day prior to beginning the intervention (i.e., pretest) as well as the day following the completion of the intervention (i.e., posttest) during each trimester. The teacher of the exploratory Health class administered these assessments for the intervention-group students, while the teachers of the various elective courses administered these assessments for the control-group students. During the course of the study, the control-group elective courses consisted of art, keyboarding, and woodshop—none of which included curriculum related to social, emotional, or behavioral development in youth. To enhance administration fidelity of the surveys and prevent against confounding teacher effects, all teachers were provided with a one-page, scripted handout consisting of an administration protocol, which was reviewed with them by the first author. The teachers reported that they followed the protocol appropriately; however, no observational implementation fidelity was taken. For both pretest and posttest administrations, and across control and intervention groups, all students completed these assessments in less than 10 min. Following each test administration (i.e., pre and post) during each trimester, the assessments were retrieved from all participating teachers and entered into an electronic database.
To measure implementation fidelity and therefore feasibility of the P3R, the Health teacher was provided with the appropriate P3R-IFC for each implementation, depending on the duration (i.e., 5-lesson or 8-lesson versions), and completed self-ratings immediately following each intervention session. Given that four classes received the intervention each trimester, the teacher completed 20 checklists the first trimester (for five lessons), 20 more the second trimester (for five lessons), and 32 the last trimester (for eight lessons)—resulting in a total of 72 self-completed fidelity checklists. To enhance the validity of the teacher’s self-reports, the first author conducted implementation fidelity observations using the P3R-IFC for approximately 25% of the intervention lessons during each trimester. Moreover, following the conclusion of all interventions, the Health teacher completed the IRP-P3R and the P3R-SVQ.
Data Analyses
Preliminary Analyses
Given that the BAS-SF and PSBSS were original with this study, preliminary analyses were conducted to explore their initial psychometric properties, using a subsample of 105 students from the first-trimester control group. One-week test–retest reliability was assessed for each of the seven items comprising the BAS-SF and each of the four items comprising the PSBSS, to ensure that the items amassing both composites were tenable. Following, test–retest reliability was also assessed for the BAS-SF and PSBSS composites. Internal consistency analyses were also conducted for the items comprising each measure, to ensure that it represented a unified underlying construct. Finally, to further confirm the reliability results, exploratory factor analyses—employing the Maximum Likelihood extraction method with a Promax (oblique) rotation—were conducted to determine the statistical dimensionality of both measures.
Beyond these analyses, the appropriateness of the projected usage of two-way factorial ANCOVA for some of the primary analyses was investigated by checking the assumptions for this particular analysis against the parameters of the current data set. Also, given that two separate ANCOVA analyses were projected, a Bonferonni’s adjustment was performed to prevent inflation of family-wise error, and power analyses were carried out to ascertain whether sufficient power would be obtained to identify statistically significant effects, if present.
Primary Analyses
The primary analyses of this study were conducted to investigate the three aforementioned research questions. Implementation fidelity for each intervention iteration was assessed via a two-stage quantitative descriptive analysis: first, fidelity for each lesson was assessed via summing the number of implemented components and dividing that by the total number of components per lesson, resulting in a percentage; second, a fidelity subtotal for each iteration implementation was ascertained and reported by summing all of the resulting percentages from each lesson within each duration iteration and then determining the mean percentage for each. Moreover, teacher perceptions of social validity were assessed by quantitative and qualitative means: first, all responses to items on the IRP-P3R were summed to produce a composite score, which was then judged against an associated descriptor indicating a level of perceived social validity (e.g., composite score >75 = high social validity); second, a general qualitative descriptive analysis of the content of the teacher’s responses to the P3R-SVQ was used to provide evidence for or against positive perceptions of the goals, procedures, and outcomes of the three intervention iterations as well as the overall intervention.
To assess the general intervention efficacy as well as possible dosage-response effects on students’ general attitudes toward bullying, an ANCOVA was conducted using the BAS-SF pretest composite group means as a covariate (i.e., to neutralize any confounding variables that may have effected baseline reports between seventh- and eighth-graders or between students in the health class and those in the other exploratory classes), the BAS-SF posttest composite group means as a dependent variable, and the Group (i.e., control or intervention) and Duration (i.e., 1-, 5-, 8-week) statuses as the between-subjects fixed-factor independent variables. Specifically, a Group main effect and a Duration × Group interaction effect were evaluated for potentially statistically significant difference between BAS-SF posttest means, followed by a descriptive mean evaluation to confirm the directionality of any noted effect as well as an effect size analysis to determine the educational import of the effect. Similarly, to assess the general intervention efficacy as well as possible dosage-response effects on students’ perceptions of their school’s bullying supports, a separate ANCOVA was conducted using the PSBSS pretest composite group means as a covariate, the PSBSS posttest composite group means as a dependent variable, and the Group and Duration statuses as the between-subjects fixed-factor independent variables. Again, a Group main effect and a Duration × Group interaction effect were evaluated for potentially statistically significant difference between PSBSS posttest means, followed by a descriptive mean evaluation to confirm the directionality of any noted effect as well as an effect size analysis to determine the educational import of the effect.

Results
Preliminary Outcomes
Psychometric Explorations
For both the BAS-SF and the PSBSS, results from the test–retest reliability analyses revealed at least moderate, statistically significant bivariate correlations for all items, r > .50, as well as both composites, r > .65, suggesting adequate overall reliability for attitudinal measurements that may be somewhat inherently variable. Furthermore, the internal consistency analysis indicated acceptable results for both the BAS-SF and the PSBSS, Cronbach’s α = .88 and .73, respectively, suggesting each composite adequately represents a single underlying attitudinal construct. Moreover, results from the BAS-SF exploratory factor analysis indicated that only one factor was extracted, which accounted for approximately 50% of the total variance (Eigen value = 3.94) and had moderate to high loadings across all seven items, >.55, suggesting unidimensionality. Similarly, results from the PSBSS exploratory factor analysis indicated that only one factor was extracted, which accounted for approximately 42% of the total variance and had moderate to high loadings across all four items, >.57, also suggesting unidimensionality. Taken together, results from these analyses suggest that the BAS-SF and the PSBSS had adequate psychometric properties to justify using their composite scores as representations of attitudinal constructs.
ANCOVA Assumption Checks
All ANCOVA assumptions—including (a) independence of observations, (b) homogeneity of variance, (c) multivariate normality across each group distribution, (d) adequate and equal group sample sizes, (e) low measurement error for the covariate, (f) a linear relationship between the covariate and the dependent variable, (g) homogeneity of covariate regression coefficients, (h) lack of substantial covariate outliers, (g) general additivity, and (h) independence of the error term—were checked and deemed to be met or, if not met, deemed to be robust in spite of such violations. For example, given that the present study was quasi-experimental and thus lacked random group assignment, a significant Group main effect was found at baseline for both the BAS-SF composite distribution, F(1) = 48.27, p < .001, and the PSBSS composite distribution, F(1) = 18.41, p < .001. Thus, the error term could not be considered independent of the covariates and the categorical independent variables because systematic, statistically significant difference was identified between the groups at baseline. Nevertheless, despite this violation, ANCOVA remains the most appropriate analysis for repeated-measures, pre-post quasi-experimental designs (cf. Tabachnick and Fidell 1996) and was thus considered appropriate for the primary analyses.
Bonferonni’s Adjustment and Power Analyses
Bonferonni’s adjustment, which divided the original significance level, α = .05, by the total number of planned analyses (i.e., two), resulted in a modified significance level of α = .025. Considering this adjusted significance level with the total number of groups within each projected analysis (i.e., six), and assuming that at least a moderate effect size (partial η2 ≥ .06) would be obtained for each analysis, Power analyses indicated that all current group sample sizes, n ≥ 100, were more than adequate for securing adequate power, ≥.80, for all F-tests.
Primary Outcomes
Intervention Feasibility and Social Validity
Results from the quantitative descriptive analyses indicated that the teacher’s mean self-reported fidelity rating for proportion of intervention components administered per lesson was high: 87% for the 1-week implementation, 92% for the 5-week implementation, 95% for the 8-week implementation, and 91% for total lesson administrations. The trustworthiness of these ratings was corroborated via high inter-rater reliability established between the teacher’s and independent observer’s fidelity ratings, Cohen’s κ = .90, suggesting adequate overall implementation fidelity. Furthermore, the teacher’s total IRP-P3R composite score was 79, putting the average item response in the “agree” to “strongly agree” range, M = 5.27, indicating a very favorable perception of the overall social validity of P3R as a classroom intervention within the particular school and classroom context. Moreover, the teacher’s qualitative responses on the P3R-SVQ confirmed her very favorable perception of goals, procedures, and outcomes of the P3R intervention. Specifically, she remarked that (a) students in her classes needed the intervention because they lacked awareness and knowledge related to bullying dynamics; (b) the overall intervention was feasibly implemented within her classes under typical classroom conditions; (c) the content of the intervention was perceived as realistic by both herself and the students; and (d) P3R appeared to enhance students’ mindfulness of their actions, words, and attitudes related to bullying—as evidence by informal observations of changes in student social interactions in the classroom during and following the intervention. Furthermore, the Health teacher also remarked on the P3R-SVQ that (e) all intervention durations seemed equally feasible to implement and that (f) she did not perceive any dosage-response effects—or differences in student attitude or behavior changes—between the 1-, 5-, and 8-week iterations.
General Intervention Efficacy
Results from the two-way factorial ANCOVA using the BAS-SF pretest scores as a covariate and the BAS-SF posttest scores as the dependent variable indicated a statistically significant Group main effect, F(1) = 9.93, p = .002, with a small effect size, partial η2 = .02. A descriptive evaluation of the resulting estimated marginal means from this analysis indicated that the total posttest marginal mean for the intervention group was approximately two mean points higher than the total posttest marginal mean for the control group, indicating positive improvements in intervention-group students’ general attitudes toward bullying. Moreover, results from the two-way factorial ANCOVA using the PSBSS pretest scores as a covariate and the PSBSS posttest scores as the dependent variable also revealed a significant Group main effect, F(1) = 7.25, p = .007, with a small effect size, partial η2 = .01. A descriptive evaluation of the resulting estimated marginal means from this analysis indicated that the total posttest marginal mean for the intervention group was approximately one mean point higher than the total posttest marginal mean for the control group, indicating positive attitudinal improvements in intervention-group students’ perceptions of their school’s bullying supports.
Dosage-Response Effects
Results from the same two-way factorial ANCOVAs described above, using the BAS-SF and PSBSS pretest scores as covariates and the BAS-SF and PSBSS posttest scores as the dependent variables, indicated nonsignificant Group × Duration interaction effects for both general attitudes toward bullying, F(2) = .67, p = .51, as well as perceptions of the school’s bullying supports, F(2) = .85, p = .43, which suggests no dosage-response effects were observed for either outcome measure (see Table 1 for a summary of all primary ANCOVA results).

Preliminary Outcomes
Psychometric Explorations
For both the BAS-SF and the PSBSS, results from the test–retest reliability analyses revealed at least moderate, statistically significant bivariate correlations for all items, r > .50, as well as both composites, r > .65, suggesting adequate overall reliability for attitudinal measurements that may be somewhat inherently variable. Furthermore, the internal consistency analysis indicated acceptable results for both the BAS-SF and the PSBSS, Cronbach’s α = .88 and .73, respectively, suggesting each composite adequately represents a single underlying attitudinal construct. Moreover, results from the BAS-SF exploratory factor analysis indicated that only one factor was extracted, which accounted for approximately 50% of the total variance (Eigen value = 3.94) and had moderate to high loadings across all seven items, >.55, suggesting unidimensionality. Similarly, results from the PSBSS exploratory factor analysis indicated that only one factor was extracted, which accounted for approximately 42% of the total variance and had moderate to high loadings across all four items, >.57, also suggesting unidimensionality. Taken together, results from these analyses suggest that the BAS-SF and the PSBSS had adequate psychometric properties to justify using their composite scores as representations of attitudinal constructs.
ANCOVA Assumption Checks
All ANCOVA assumptions—including (a) independence of observations, (b) homogeneity of variance, (c) multivariate normality across each group distribution, (d) adequate and equal group sample sizes, (e) low measurement error for the covariate, (f) a linear relationship between the covariate and the dependent variable, (g) homogeneity of covariate regression coefficients, (h) lack of substantial covariate outliers, (g) general additivity, and (h) independence of the error term—were checked and deemed to be met or, if not met, deemed to be robust in spite of such violations. For example, given that the present study was quasi-experimental and thus lacked random group assignment, a significant Group main effect was found at baseline for both the BAS-SF composite distribution, F(1) = 48.27, p < .001, and the PSBSS composite distribution, F(1) = 18.41, p < .001. Thus, the error term could not be considered independent of the covariates and the categorical independent variables because systematic, statistically significant difference was identified between the groups at baseline. Nevertheless, despite this violation, ANCOVA remains the most appropriate analysis for repeated-measures, pre-post quasi-experimental designs (cf. Tabachnick and Fidell 1996) and was thus considered appropriate for the primary analyses.
Bonferonni’s Adjustment and Power Analyses
Bonferonni’s adjustment, which divided the original significance level, α = .05, by the total number of planned analyses (i.e., two), resulted in a modified significance level of α = .025. Considering this adjusted significance level with the total number of groups within each projected analysis (i.e., six), and assuming that at least a moderate effect size (partial η2 ≥ .06) would be obtained for each analysis, Power analyses indicated that all current group sample sizes, n ≥ 100, were more than adequate for securing adequate power, ≥.80, for all F-tests.
Primary Outcomes
Intervention Feasibility and Social Validity
Results from the quantitative descriptive analyses indicated that the teacher’s mean self-reported fidelity rating for proportion of intervention components administered per lesson was high: 87% for the 1-week implementation, 92% for the 5-week implementation, 95% for the 8-week implementation, and 91% for total lesson administrations. The trustworthiness of these ratings was corroborated via high inter-rater reliability established between the teacher’s and independent observer’s fidelity ratings, Cohen’s κ = .90, suggesting adequate overall implementation fidelity. Furthermore, the teacher’s total IRP-P3R composite score was 79, putting the average item response in the “agree” to “strongly agree” range, M = 5.27, indicating a very favorable perception of the overall social validity of P3R as a classroom intervention within the particular school and classroom context. Moreover, the teacher’s qualitative responses on the P3R-SVQ confirmed her very favorable perception of goals, procedures, and outcomes of the P3R intervention. Specifically, she remarked that (a) students in her classes needed the intervention because they lacked awareness and knowledge related to bullying dynamics; (b) the overall intervention was feasibly implemented within her classes under typical classroom conditions; (c) the content of the intervention was perceived as realistic by both herself and the students; and (d) P3R appeared to enhance students’ mindfulness of their actions, words, and attitudes related to bullying—as evidence by informal observations of changes in student social interactions in the classroom during and following the intervention. Furthermore, the Health teacher also remarked on the P3R-SVQ that (e) all intervention durations seemed equally feasible to implement and that (f) she did not perceive any dosage-response effects—or differences in student attitude or behavior changes—between the 1-, 5-, and 8-week iterations.
General Intervention Efficacy
Results from the two-way factorial ANCOVA using the BAS-SF pretest scores as a covariate and the BAS-SF posttest scores as the dependent variable indicated a statistically significant Group main effect, F(1) = 9.93, p = .002, with a small effect size, partial η2 = .02. A descriptive evaluation of the resulting estimated marginal means from this analysis indicated that the total posttest marginal mean for the intervention group was approximately two mean points higher than the total posttest marginal mean for the control group, indicating positive improvements in intervention-group students’ general attitudes toward bullying. Moreover, results from the two-way factorial ANCOVA using the PSBSS pretest scores as a covariate and the PSBSS posttest scores as the dependent variable also revealed a significant Group main effect, F(1) = 7.25, p = .007, with a small effect size, partial η2 = .01. A descriptive evaluation of the resulting estimated marginal means from this analysis indicated that the total posttest marginal mean for the intervention group was approximately one mean point higher than the total posttest marginal mean for the control group, indicating positive attitudinal improvements in intervention-group students’ perceptions of their school’s bullying supports.
Dosage-Response Effects
Results from the same two-way factorial ANCOVAs described above, using the BAS-SF and PSBSS pretest scores as covariates and the BAS-SF and PSBSS posttest scores as the dependent variables, indicated nonsignificant Group × Duration interaction effects for both general attitudes toward bullying, F(2) = .67, p = .51, as well as perceptions of the school’s bullying supports, F(2) = .85, p = .43, which suggests no dosage-response effects were observed for either outcome measure (see Table 1 for a summary of all primary ANCOVA results).

Discussion
Interpretation of Results
The present study investigated the feasibility and social validity, general intervention efficacy, and dosage-response effects of teacher-implemented P3R Classroom Resource interventions on attitudinal outcomes of junior-high school students. Findings from the analyses of resulting data suggest that the intervention was feasible for the Health teacher to implement independently and that it was socially valid within the particular school and classroom contexts—as evidenced by high implementation fidelity and positive teacher perceptions of P3R’s goals, procedures, and outcomes across implementations. Moreover, findings from this study suggest that P3R marginally enhanced students’ attitudes toward bullying as well as their perceptions of their school’s bullying supports, resulting in more prosocial attitudes overall—as evidenced by statistically significant changes in mean attitudinal scores accompanied by small effect sizes. Furthermore, findings from this study suggest no dosage-response effects among the 1-, 5-, and 8-week iterations of P3R, indicating relatively equivalent effectiveness of implementations—as evidenced by statistically non-significant differences in mean attitudinal scores across durations. Taken together, these findings suggest that, as used in the present study, the P3R Classroom Resource was feasibly implemented, socially valid, and marginally effective as an intervention for enhancing students’ general attitudes toward bullying as well as their attitudes toward their school’s bullying supports.
As noted previously herein, the P3R Classroom Resource differs from the majority of mainstream universal-level bullying interventions (cf. Jimerson & Huai, 2010), as it is amenable to implementation within smaller-scale and briefer implementation periods (e.g., 1 week to 2 months), is characterized by low-resource intensiveness (i.e., requires little involvement from outside support staff as well as little training and support materials), is amenable to investigation of isolated intervention components (i.e., classroom-based intervention only), and is characterized by an orientation toward prosocial behavior and attitude development (i.e., cultivation of knowledge, empathy, and problem-solving skills). Considering this, the positive findings resulting from the present study enhance the warrant for further research into a new wave of bullying intervention and prevention programing, which, similar to P3R, can be feasibly implemented by educators at the local site level and still facilitate positive student outcomes. Intervention efforts of this nature are likely to be highly sustainable (cf. Larson & Busse, 2006), but much empirical research will be needed to prove their efficacy.
Nevertheless, given the current dearth of studies investigating the feasibility and social validity of bullying interventions (Olweus, 2010), findings from the present study are encouraging: providing a case example of a teacher who accurately and effectively implemented P3R amidst her typical school duties. Yet given the dearth of studies investigating possible dosage-response effects for bullying interventions (Merrell et al., 2008), findings from this study are essentially neutral: providing no evidence for preferring shorter implementation durations (i.e., 1-week) over longer ones (i.e., 5-, 8-week). Moreover, given the preponderance of evidence indicating only marginal changes in student outcomes resulting from bullying interventions (e.g., Smith et al., 2004), findings from the present study serve to strengthen the status quo of student outcomes: providing another example of small, positive intervention effects on students’ social attitudes. Given that the content and method of P3R is comprised of several empirically promising program features (e.g., video-based curriculum, social problem-solving orientation, empathic involvement of students; e.g., Hazler & Carney, 2006), this last finding may seem surprising. However, a reconsideration of the bullying intervention literature suggests at least four possible limitations that may account for such marginal effects: (a) an internal-potency limitation of the intervention itself; (b) an overall dosage-response limitation; (c) a problematic measurement limitation; and (d) sampling bias and research design limitations.
Limitations and Future Research
Internal-Potency
The effectiveness of the P3R Classroom Resource to enhance students’ prosocial attitudes may have been limited by its internal-potency, meaning that the intervention’s contents and methods may have not been potent enough to facilitate more remarkable student outcomes. A critical evaluation of P3R’s content and methods in relation to the literature regarding effective characteristics of bullying programs suggests that although its method is characterized by several empirically promising features (e.g., video-based instruction and a social problem-solving orientation), its content is lacking one fundamental component that has been associated with stronger student outcomes: direct social-skills instruction (cf. Hazler & Carney, 2006). Thus, the potency of P3R may be limited by the exclusion of a skills acquisition component. To test this hypothesis, future studies could investigate the effectiveness of the intervention as is—or without social-skills training—compared to the effectiveness of the intervention enhanced—or with a social-skills training component. However, by adding a social-skills training component to P3R, the program is likely to become more similar to other preexisting bullying interventions and may, as a result, become more difficult for general educators and other school-based practitioners to implement accurately and independently. Recognizing that “any method, regardless of its empirical merit, is only as valid as the probability that school-based personnel will use it in a reliable and effective manner” (Scott et al., 2004, p. 190), we recommend that future research seek to strike a balance between empirical rigor and social validity—aiming for sustainability at the local site level.
Dosage-Response
The present study may also be limited by an overall dosage-response threshold. Although part of the original intention of the study was to investigate various brief dosage-response effects (i.e., 1-, 5-, 8-week), it is possible that each intervention duration was too brief to facilitate more remarkable student outcomes, failing to meet a dosage-response threshold. Thus, the same intervention, if administered over longer periods of time—such as 3–5 months, as opposed to 1 or 2 months—may be capable of facilitating more remarkable student outcomes. This hypothesis is supported by a large body of educational research indicating the significant role of duration in enhancing the effectiveness of interventions (e.g., Zelezny, 1999); however, it remains largely uninvestigated as pertaining to bullying interventions (Olweus, 2010). Thus, we recommend that future research is warranted to investigate the possibility of a duration-response threshold for the P3R Classroom Resource and similar bullying interventions, which may require stretching their recommended implementation periods.
Problematic Measurement
Another possible limitation of the present study is problematic measurement. In the present study, post hoc analyses revealed that baseline results from both measures revealed significantly non-normal, positively skewed distributions. Such results suggest substantial ceiling effects for baseline responding, in which large proportions of students were already responding prosocially to both outcome indicators prior to receiving the intervention—resulting in a significantly lower likelihood of identifying statistically significant results with moderate to large effect sizes at posttest (cf. McHorney & Tarlov, 1995). Thus, although it is possible that students in the present study already possessed extremely prosocial attitudes toward bullying and positive perceptions of their local school bullying supports at baseline, it is also possible that the suggested measurement ceiling effect is attributable to a social-desirability response effect. Given all of the items in both measures used some form of the word “bullying,” which carries an inherently negative connotation, students may have been primed to respond in an overly prosocial manner at baseline. If this was the case, it could have blurred the descriptive comparison between posttest responses, which may have been more honest or accurate than those at baseline and thus lessened the integrity of construct validity (cf. Furlong, Sharkey, Felix, Tanigawa, & Green, 2010). Given that concerns with problematic measurement have been described as the “Achilles heel of bullying prevention efforts” (Cornell, Sheras, & Cole, 2006, p. 193), we recommend that future research is warranted to develop psychometrically sound measures with high comparative and practical utility.
Sampling Bias and Research Design
Finally, a general sampling bias and other unintended research design features may have also limited the present study. For example, given that this study utilized the natural classroom groupings of students to serve as the bases for determining group membership, it is possible that such nonprobabilistic or convenience sampling may be confounded by other characteristics unique to students in the Health class intervention group (cf. Heppner, Wampold, & Kivlighan, 2007). Specifically, because the P3R Classroom Resource was presented in a Health class, it is possible that class content or activities presented prior to or in conjunction with P3R may have confounded the intervention effects. Although such sampling bias is undesirable, it was largely unavoidable in the present study, as the school’s administration selected the intervention for inclusion with the exploratory Health class only. Nevertheless, future studies within similar lines of research may compensate for this possible confound by arranging for implementations of P3R or other bullying interventions across multiple classroom settings (e.g., Mathematics, Language Arts, and Technology), thereby creating a categorical classroom variable that can be investigated as a random-effect within a larger general linear model (cf. Hancock & Mueller, 2010). Moreover, given that the present study lacked follow-up measurements of students’ attitudes post-intervention, we recommend that future bullying intervention studies utilize longitudinal research designs to test whether student outcomes decline, maintain, or improve following intervention paired with typical developmental maturation.
Implications for Practitioners
A couple of important implications for school-based practice can be derived from the present study. First, findings from the present study suggest that classroom teachers and, by extension, other educational professionals (e.g., school psychologists) may be capable of implementing P3R with high fidelity and resulting in high social validity as a brief, universal-level bullying intervention. However, because only one teacher’s implementations were evaluated in the present study, more studies with more teachers in different contexts are needed prior to making any substantive generalizations. Second, findings from the present study suggest that P3R had positive effects on students’ prosocial attitudes regarding bullying and school climate and thus may be an empirically promising school-based intervention. Nevertheless, because this is one of the first empirical investigations of P3R and only small effect sizes resulted in the present study, more studies with more compelling evidence are needed before P3R can be recommended as an evidence-based practice. Moreover, given current educational policy and the general scientific zeitgeist regarding selecting best practices (e.g., Slavin, 2002), if P3R is chosen for school-based use as a pilot intervention, we strongly recommend that school-based practitioners inform all involved parties of the status of its current empirical validation.

Discussion

Interpretation of Results
The present study investigated the feasibility and social validity, general intervention efficacy, and dosage-response effects of teacher-implemented P3R Classroom Resource interventions on attitudinal outcomes of junior-high school students. Findings from the analyses of resulting data suggest that the intervention was feasible for the Health teacher to implement independently and that it was socially valid within the particular school and classroom contexts—as evidenced by high implementation fidelity and positive teacher perceptions of P3R’s goals, procedures, and outcomes across implementations. Moreover, findings from this study suggest that P3R marginally enhanced students’ attitudes toward bullying as well as their perceptions of their school’s bullying supports, resulting in more prosocial attitudes overall—as evidenced by statistically significant changes in mean attitudinal scores accompanied by small effect sizes. Furthermore, findings from this study suggest no dosage-response effects among the 1-, 5-, and 8-week iterations of P3R, indicating relatively equivalent effectiveness of implementations—as evidenced by statistically non-significant differences in mean attitudinal scores across durations. Taken together, these findings suggest that, as used in the present study, the P3R Classroom Resource was feasibly implemented, socially valid, and marginally effective as an intervention for enhancing students’ general attitudes toward bullying as well as their attitudes toward their school’s bullying supports.
As noted previously herein, the P3R Classroom Resource differs from the majority of mainstream universal-level bullying interventions (cf. Jimerson & Huai, 2010), as it is amenable to implementation within smaller-scale and briefer implementation periods (e.g., 1 week to 2 months), is characterized by low-resource intensiveness (i.e., requires little involvement from outside support staff as well as little training and support materials), is amenable to investigation of isolated intervention components (i.e., classroom-based intervention only), and is characterized by an orientation toward prosocial behavior and attitude development (i.e., cultivation of knowledge, empathy, and problem-solving skills). Considering this, the positive findings resulting from the present study enhance the warrant for further research into a new wave of bullying intervention and prevention programing, which, similar to P3R, can be feasibly implemented by educators at the local site level and still facilitate positive student outcomes. Intervention efforts of this nature are likely to be highly sustainable (cf. Larson & Busse, 2006), but much empirical research will be needed to prove their efficacy.

Moreover, given the preponderance of evidence indicating only marginal changes in student outcomes resulting from bullying interventions (e.g., Smith et al., 2004), findings from the present study serve to strengthen the status quo of student outcomes: providing another example of small, positive intervention effects on students’ social attitudes. Given that the content and method of P3R is comprised of several empirically promising program features (e.g., video-based curriculum, social problem-solving orientation, empathic involvement of students; e.g., Hazler & Carney, 2006), this last finding may seem surprising. However, a reconsideration of the bullying intervention literature suggests at least four possible limitations that may account for such marginal effects: (a) an internal-potency limitation of the intervention itself; (b) an overall dosage-response limitation; (c) a problematic measurement limitation; and (d) sampling bias and research design limitations.

The effectiveness of the P3R Classroom Resource to enhance students’ prosocial attitudes may have been limited by its internal-potency, meaning that the intervention’s contents and methods may have not been potent enough to facilitate more remarkable student outcomes. A critical evaluation of P3R’s content and methods in relation to the literature regarding effective characteristics of bullying programs suggests that although its method is characterized by several empirically promising features (e.g., video-based instruction and a social problem-solving orientation), its content is lacking one fundamental component that has been associated with stronger student outcomes: direct social-skills instruction (cf. Hazler & Carney, 2006). Thus, the potency of P3R may be limited by the exclusion of a skills acquisition component. To test this hypothesis, future studies could investigate the effectiveness of the intervention as is—or without social-skills training—compared to the effectiveness of the intervention enhanced—or with a social-skills training component. However, by adding a social-skills training component to P3R, the program is likely to become more similar to other preexisting bullying interventions and may, as a result, become more difficult for general educators and other school-based practitioners to implement accurately and independently. Recognizing that “any method, regardless of its empirical merit, is only as valid as the probability that school-based personnel will use it in a reliable and effective manner” (Scott et al., 2004, p. 190), we recommend that future research seek to strike a balance between empirical rigor and social validity—aiming for sustainability at the local site level.
Dosage-Response
The present study may also be limited by an overall dosage-response threshold. Although part of the original intention of the study was to investigate various brief dosage-response effects (i.e., 1-, 5-, 8-week), it is possible that each intervention duration was too brief to facilitate more remarkable student outcomes, failing to meet a dosage-response threshold. Thus, the same intervention, if administered over longer periods of time—such as 3–5 months, as opposed to 1 or 2 months—may be capable of facilitating more remarkable student outcomes. This hypothesis is supported by a large body of educational research indicating the significant role of duration in enhancing the effectiveness of interventions (e.g., Zelezny, 1999); however, it remains largely uninvestigated as pertaining to bullying interventions (Olweus, 2010). Thus, we recommend that future research is warranted to investigate the possibility of a duration-response threshold for the P3R Classroom Resource and similar bullying interventions, which may require stretching their recommended implementation periods.
Problematic Measurement
Another possible limitation of the present study is problematic measurement. In the present study, post hoc analyses revealed that baseline results from both measures revealed significantly non-normal, positively skewed distributions. Such results suggest substantial ceiling effects for baseline responding, in which large proportions of students were already responding prosocially to both outcome indicators prior to receiving the intervention—resulting in a significantly lower likelihood of identifying statistically significant results with moderate to large effect sizes at posttest (cf. McHorney & Tarlov, 1995). Thus, although it is possible that students in the present study already possessed extremely prosocial attitudes toward bullying and positive perceptions of their local school bullying supports at baseline, it is also possible that the suggested measurement ceiling effect is attributable to a social-desirability response effect. Given all of the items in both measures used some form of the word “bullying,” which carries an inherently negative connotation, students may have been primed to respond in an overly prosocial manner at baseline. If this was the case, it could have blurred the descriptive comparison between posttest responses, which may have been more honest or accurate than those at baseline and thus lessened the integrity of construct validity (cf. Furlong, Sharkey, Felix, Tanigawa, & Green, 2010). Given that concerns with problematic measurement have been described as the “Achilles heel of bullying prevention efforts” (Cornell, Sheras, & Cole, 2006, p. 193), we recommend that future research is warranted to develop psychometrically sound measures with high comparative and practical utility.
Sampling Bias and Research Design
Finally, a general sampling bias and other unintended research design features may have also limited the present study. For example, given that this study utilized the natural classroom groupings of students to serve as the bases for determining group membership, it is possible that such nonprobabilistic or convenience sampling may be confounded by other characteristics unique to students in the Health class intervention group (cf. Heppner, Wampold, & Kivlighan, 2007). Specifically, because the P3R Classroom Resource was presented in a Health class, it is possible that class content or activities presented prior to or in conjunction with P3R may have confounded the intervention effects. Although such sampling bias is undesirable, it was largely unavoidable in the present study, as the school’s administration selected the intervention for inclusion with the exploratory Health class only. Nevertheless, future studies within similar lines of research may compensate for this possible confound by arranging for implementations of P3R or other bullying interventions across multiple classroom settings (e.g., Mathematics, Language Arts, and Technology), thereby creating a categorical classroom variable that can be investigated as a random-effect within a larger general linear model (cf. Hancock & Mueller, 2010). Moreover, given that the present study lacked follow-up measurements of students’ attitudes post-intervention, we recommend that future bullying intervention studies utilize longitudinal research designs to test whether student outcomes decline, maintain, or improve following intervention paired with typical developmental maturation.
Implications for Practitioners
A couple of important implications for school-based practice can be derived from the present study. First, findings from the present study suggest that classroom teachers and, by extension, other educational professionals (e.g., school psychologists) may be capable of implementing P3R with high fidelity and resulting in high social validity as a brief, universal-level bullying intervention. However, because only one teacher’s implementations were evaluated in the present study, more studies with more teachers in different contexts are needed prior to making any substantive generalizations. Second, findings from the present study suggest that P3R had positive effects on students’ prosocial attitudes regarding bullying and school climate and thus may be an empirically promising school-based intervention. Nevertheless, because this is one of the first empirical investigations of P3R and only small effect sizes resulted in the present study, more studies with more compelling evidence are needed before P3R can be recommended as an evidence-based practice. Moreover, given current educational policy and the general scientific zeitgeist regarding selecting best practices (e.g., Slavin, 2002), if P3R is chosen for school-based use as a pilot intervention, we strongly recommend that school-based practitioners inform all involved parties of the status of its current empirical validation.

Conclusion
The present study investigated the effects of a new, brief, universal-level bullying intervention—the P3R Classroom Resource. Findings indicated that the intervention had small, positive effects on student attitudes and was feasibly implemented by the classroom teacher, with high perceptions of social validity. Given the preliminary nature of these findings, we hope that scholars and school-based practitioners will collaborate in validating P3R and other similar bullying interventions—continually striving to balance empirical rigor with social validity in pursuit of enhancing youth’s mental health and well-being through school-based prevention and intervention efforts. Ultimately, we hope that efforts in this line of applied research will increasingly move toward developing and evaluating bullying interventions that are sustainable at the local site level—empowering school communities with the tools and skills necessary to efficiently prevent bullying-related problems.
