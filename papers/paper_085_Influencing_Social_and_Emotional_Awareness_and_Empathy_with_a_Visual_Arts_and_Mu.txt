Abstract
Art and music create a powerful presence in the lives of youths. Skills gained from participating in the arts can better facilitate social and emotional learning (SEL) such as improving goal setting, increasing empathy, building relationships, and improving decision making. Connect with Kids, an SEL program that focuses on social and emotional skill building through the use of visual arts and music, was implemented in an urban high school in the Northeast. A total of 304 high school students participated in the study. Students from eight classrooms received the intervention (n = 143); students from another 10 classrooms (n = 161) comprised the comparison group and did not receive the intervention. The average youth was 14 years old, white, and female. Results indicated that the Connect with Kids program increased positive social and emotional behaviors among students compared with the comparison group. Examining the implications of the intervention advances gaps in the literature on SEL programs, supports integrating SEL programming on music and art in schools, and promotes continued program evaluation of unique SEL programming specifically for high school students.

Issue Section: Article
Adolescence is a period when behavioral health problems can arise and negatively influence youth well-being. Studies suggest that youths who are bullied or victimized during adolescence may display signs of depression and aggression later in life (Reijntjes et al., 2011; Reijntjes, Kamphuis, Prinzie, & Telch, 2010). Extreme school discipline policies can also lead youths toward delinquency (Okonofua, Walton, & Eberhardt, 2016). Increasing youth social and emotional learning (SEL) results in more positive behaviors including increased school success, decreased substance use, and decreased harassment and violence (Caemmerer & Keith, 2015; Cook, Williams, Guerra, Kim, & Sadek, 2010; Tobler et al., 2000). SEL is an improvement in the knowledge, attitudes, and values for effectively identifying and controlling emotions, creating and completing goals, making responsible decisions, and handling interpersonal relationships.

The five SEL core competencies introduced by the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL, 2012) framework include self-management, self-awareness, responsible decision making, relationship skills, and social awareness. Integrating SEL programs into school curricula using the CASEL framework has been shown to positively affect behavioral, social, and emotional outcomes (Bierman et al., 2010; Durlak, Weissberg, Dymnicki, Taylor, & Schellinger, 2011; Sklad, Diekstra, Ritter, Ben, & Gravesteijn, 2012). In addition, SEL programs have the optimal ratio for cost and benefit for mental health interventions (Knapp, McDaid, & Parsonage, 2011). Therefore, SEL programs for adolescents are appealing, as they try to help youths cope by improving skills and mind-sets.

Although many schools have started implementing SEL programs, most programs are targeted for younger elementary school ages. Programs for high school youths have not yet been recognized as effective as those that intervene in the earlier years (Durlak et al., 2011; Schwalbe, Gearing, Mackenzie, Brewer, & Ibrahim, 2012; Yeager, Fong, Lee, & Espelage, 2015). As students enter into their teenage years, they are more likely to lose their connectedness to school (Blum & Libbey, 2004; Klem & Connell, 2004) and engage in more risky behaviors (Eaton et al., 2008). Therefore, high school students are an important population of focus for SEL programs.

Given the growing popularity of these programs within school settings, rigorous evaluations of SEL programs have been largely underused. A meta-analysis of 213 SEL programs involving students starting at kindergarten through high school reported that 77 percent of the program evaluations are shorter than a year, and not all interventions have positive outcomes (Durlak et al., 2011). In addition to the lack of program evaluations, SEL programs have not considered gender differences when designing SEL programs and several meta-analyses do not mention the students’ gender (Coelho, Marchante, & Sousa, 2015; Hahn et al., 2007).

The majority of research on universal school-based SEL programs report differential impact on gender (Bierman et al., 2010; Coelho et al., 2015; Shapiro, Burgoon, Welker, & Clough, 2002). For example, the Peacemakers program was implemented with sixth-grade students and boys were more affected by the SEL program, showing a decrease in violent behavior and improved social skills (Shapiro et al., 2002). In an implementation of the Second Step program, only girls benefited, with an increase in social competence (Holsen, Smith, & Frey, 2008). These studies indicate that SEL programs often have differential results based on gender and that evaluation of SEL programs should consider gender as a moderating factor. Participant characteristics such as gender are vital to understanding differential effects of these programs (Durlak et al., 2011).

Art and music may also play an integral role in SEL programming. There are countless ways in which social–emotional competence can be addressed in the art and music room, from individualized art making and song development activities for goal achievement to art and music critical thinking and discussion about visual and music culture. These discussions can explore social and cultural issues that have real-life implications and are engaging to youths in collaborative activities. In the music and art classroom, youths can work on projects that focus on empathy, self-esteem, and responsibility. A recent study of youths indicated that art therapy programs can increase resilience and SEL that decreases the risk of future psychological problems (Sitzer & Stockwell, 2015). In addition, research on art-based community work with youths in low-income neighborhoods demonstrates that art-based programs can influence social skills such as relationship building, conflict resolution, and team work skills (Wright, Alaggia, & Krygsman, 2013; Wright, John, Alaggia, & Sheel, 2006). However, literature on the development and evaluation of incorporating art and music into SEL programming is scarce. Therefore, through art making and critical thinking and discussion of images and songs, infusing SEL into art and music allows facilitators to “teach explicitly those understandings, skills, and dispositions that positively affect student discipline as a regular part of the art curriculum” (Russell & Hutzel, 2007, p. 7).

Current Program
This study evaluates the effectiveness of an SEL classroom-based program Connect with Kids. It relies on the components of the CASEL framework, but is novel due to the implementation of SEL in a visual and music arts curriculum. Connect with Kids, an evidence-based SEL program, has been shown to decrease physical and behavioral aggressive behaviors, decrease the likelihood of students using drugs and alcohol, and increase positive social and emotional behaviors among students. Connect with Kids follows the components that CASEL created in their framework (self-management, self-awareness, responsible decision making, relationship skills, and social awareness). CASEL created the framework for what should be included in SEL programs, but did not create a specific intervention. Connect with Kids has been designated as an effective program by the U.S. Department of Education under the What Works Clearinghouse. The program uses a research-proven, peer-to-peer production model that allows students and adults to connect through the power of real-life stories and video. The program was developed by the Connect with Kids Network, which uses the art of storytelling, mutual aid methodology, and see-feel-change strategies to inspire positive behavior and motivate social action (Gitterman, 1986; Schwartz, 1961; Shulman, 1986).

For the current study, Connect with Kids was implemented in an urban high school in the Northeast. The classroom materials allowed students to gain, evaluate, and present increasingly complex information, ideas, and evidence through listening and speaking. In addition, the program encouraged academic discussion in one-on-one, small group, and whole class settings in which students collaborate to answer questions, build understanding, and solve problems. Connect with Kids provided opportunities for students to grow their vocabularies through a mix of conversations, direct instruction, and reading. The program integrated technology and media in school and life for 21st century learning. In addition, Connect with Kids provided evidence-based materials that accelerates students toward career and college readiness and demonstrates research-proven usability and efficacy with a full range of students.

The current program, titled Social and Emotional Learning through Music and Visual Arts, consisted of seven lessons: attendance, achievement and college and career readiness, bullying and violence prevention, character and life skills, digital citizenship, drug and alcohol prevention, and health and wellness. Each session relied on supplemental materials to facilitate discussion and activities. Some of the major themes included bullying, suicide, depression and anxiety, and online pornography. Connect with Kids also included resources to share with parents, such as videos and print materials to assist with any difficult discussions with their youths. These sessions were strategically planned to fulfill the goals of SEL programming while being incorporated into art and music curricula. Extension and support activities were also offered in the programming, so that each teacher could respond to the needs of the students in their classroom.

Present Study
The present study seeks to add to the evidence-based practices in social–emotional interventions for high school students by examining a novel visual art and music curriculum approach. This research analyzes the impact of an SEL program integrated into a visual arts and music program for high school students compared with a group of students who did not receive the intervention. It was hypothesized that students who participated in the intervention would show improvements in their social and emotional competences when compared with students in the comparison group (hypothesis 1). Based on the literature review, we expected gender differences for the social–emotional competence, with girls starting at higher levels but also receiving more gains than boys (hypothesis 2). We also hypothesized that all facets of the social–emotional competence (perspective taking, fantasy, empathic concern, personal distress) would increase in the intervention group (hypothesis 3).

Method
Research Design
The research conducted used a quasi-experimental design. Random sampling was not feasible as a result of the inability of the school administration to randomly assign students to certain classes (intervention or comparison group). Students in both the experimental and comparison groups had signed up for music and art classes. The school administration then determined in which classes the program would be implemented based on teacher scheduling. All groups were naturally formed based on class size. Students in the comparison group received normal instruction in art and music that did not include any SEL training.

Procedure
The study was implemented between September 2016 and June 2017. The school used passive informed consent, as the program is considered part of the school curriculum. Pretests were administered at the beginning of the school year in September via Qualtrics, an online data collection software. Teachers created and assigned individual ID codes for the students when completing their pre- and posttests to assist in matching the data. Posttests were collected from both groups immediately following the intervention completion in June. If a student was absent the day of the pre- or posttest, they were given the test in another class within two weeks (n = 15). Program implementation was monitored by researchers through weekly meetings with teachers and program creators. Researchers were also available for monitoring as needed by phone and e-mail. Teachers submitted class reports and progress reports at the end of the year. There was a fairly high degree of fidelity in implementing the program that was created, with teachers reporting implementing 85 percent of the content.

Teachers completed four intensive two-hour trainings before implementing the Connect with Kids program to ensure effective administration. The curriculum was delivered by each teacher over the school year through classroom sessions that addressed (a) attendance, (b) achievement and college and career readiness, (c) bullying and violence prevention, (d) character and life skills, (e) digital citizenship, (f) drug and alcohol prevention, and (g) health and wellness. The five core competences proposed by CASEL (2012) (that is, self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision making) were embedded throughout the curriculum. Curriculum for each session included a lesson plan, video material, audio selections, print resources, discussion questions, and hands-on activities related to arts or music. The video segment provided age-appropriate information communicated through the real-life stories of teenagers and was followed by focused questions designed to help students integrate the information while practicing skills. Each session concluded with an activity to provide students with additional opportunities to focus on healthy decision making. Materials were also shared with parents after the session to further dialogue around the topic.

Measures
In an effort to measure social awareness and empathy as a multidimensional construct, we used questions from the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, which includes subscales on perspective taking, fantasy, empathic concern, and personal distress (Davis, 1983). The full scale contains 28 items, with answers solicited on a five-point Likert scale ranging from “Does not describe me well” to “Describes me very well.” The four subscales are each made up of seven different items. The subscale on perspective taking looks at the respondent’s tendency to spontaneously adopt the psychological point of view of others. The fantasy subscale taps respondents’ tendencies to transpose themselves imaginatively into the feelings and actions of fictitious characters in books, movies, and plays. The subscale on empathic concern assesses “other-oriented” feelings of sympathy and concern for unfortunate others. The final subscale on personal distress measures “self-oriented” feelings of personal anxiety and unease in tense interpersonal settings. Cronbach’s alpha for overall scale in this study was high for both pretest (.82) and posttest (.81).

Data Analysis
The pre- and posttest surveys were used to test the effectiveness of this program in developing social awareness and empathy for youths. First, a preliminary analysis examined the sociodemographic characteristics of the participants by calculating the appropriate percentage distributions for means and standard deviations. The preliminary analysis also diagnosed the study outcome variables for outliers and skewed distributions. Attrition from pre- to posttest was low, with 15 students (10 in intervention and five in comparison) not completing the posttest. These participants were excluded from analysis. Given possible issues of attrition that could affect the analysis, a study participant model was used. Using this model has limitations that include the possibility that those youths likely to drop out have greater lower levels of social and emotional wellness and represents a possible bias.

Because of the nature of the quasi-experimental design, baseline equivalence between the treatment and the comparison groups were conducted by assessing demographic and baseline characteristics on the following measures: age, gender, race, and ethnicity. The intervention group had significantly more male and more Hispanic participants than the comparison group (see Table 1). For these reasons, gender and Hispanic ethnicity were used as control variables in the following analyses. Researchers were unable to account for the nested data of students within classrooms, because of specifications of the school and teachers wanting anonymity of which classes were doing better or worse. The teachers and school administrators were fearful of data being used for evaluation of teachers’ effectiveness.

Repeated measures general linear mixed-effects models were fitted with two waves of longitudinal continuous data from pretest to posttest measurements of the study outcome. The model was specified with random intercept and random slope to account for within-subject correlations of repeated measures over time. A time × group interaction term to estimate for the linear trend difference between groups was also included in the models. Adjusted means of study outcome measures at each wave were obtained for the treatment and comparison condition groups. Partial eta2 was also calculated as a standardized effect size measure.

Results
Participants
The convenience sample was composed of mostly freshman high school students (N = 304) in one school in the Northeast. About half (51 percent) were female, 74 percent were white, and the average age was 14.06 years (SD = 0.68). Eight classrooms implemented the Connect with Kids intervention (n = 143). Ten classrooms composed the comparison group, which did not receive the intervention (n = 161). Participant characteristics are shown in Table 1.

Hypothesis 1
We hypothesized that students who participated in the visual arts and music intervention would show improvements in their social and emotional competences when compared with students in the comparison group. Repeated measures general linear mixed-effects models were fitted with two waves of longitudinal continuous data from pretest to posttest measurements to assess the impact of the social–emotional intervention compared with a control or comparison group on social emotional awareness and empathy. There was no significant interaction between program type and time, Wilks’s lambda = 0.99, F(1, 263) = 0.68, p = .41. This indicated that there is a change in scores over time for the two different groups. There was a substantial main effect for time, Wilks’s lambda = 0.98, F(1, 263) = 5.31, p = .02, partial eta2 = .02, with both groups increasing their overall social awareness and empathy from pre- to posttest. The main effects comparing the two types of intervention were significant, F(1, 263) = 4.77, p = .03, partial eta2 = .02 (see Table 2).

Hypothesis 2
We expected gender differences for the social–emotional competence, with girls starting at higher levels of social–emotional competence and receiving more gains than boys. The control variable of Hispanic ethnicity was not significant, p = .40, but gender was, F(1, 263) = 3.23, p < .001, partial eta2 = .03. Using the commonly used guidelines proposed by Cohen (1988), with .01 = small effect, .06 = moderate effect, and .14 = large effect, these results indicate small effect. Figure 1 depicts the gender differences for female and male students over time for the comparison and intervention groups. Because of small sample numbers of the gender “other” as selected by participants, they were included in the analysis, but were excluded from Table 2 (13 and seven students, respectively).

Hypothesis 3
We hypothesized that all facets of the social–emotional competence (perspective taking, fantasy, empathic concern, and personal distress) would increase in the intervention group. The subscales of the social awareness and empathy were also tested using repeated measures general linear mixed-effects models. Findings are presented in Table 2. For perspective taking, there was no significant interaction between program type and time, Wilks’s lambda = 0.98, F(1, 263) = 3.91, p = .60. This indicates that there is a change in scores over time for the two different groups. There was a main effect for time, Wilks’s lambda = 0.98, F(1, 263) = 1.01, p = .04, partial eta2 = .02. The main effects comparing the two types of intervention was significant, F(1, 263) = 4.07, p = .04, partial eta2 = .02, indicating a small effect. The control variables were not significant, gender (p = .86) and Hispanic ethnicity (p = .79). For the fantasy subscale there was no significant interaction between program type and time, Wilks’s lambda = 0.99, F(1, 263) = 0.28, p = .59, indicating a change in scores over time for the two different groups. However, there was no main effects for time, Wilks’s lambda = 0.99, F(1, 263) = 1.88, p = .17, partial eta2 = .007, indicating that over time there was no substantial change. Similarly, there was no significant finding for the main effects on the differences between the groups, F(1, 263) = 0.10, p = .75. Similarly, findings for the subscale on empathic concern indicated no significant interaction between program type and time, Wilks’s lambda = 0.10, F(1, 263) = 0.33, p = .56, partial eta2 = .001. There was no main effect for time, Wilks’s lambda = 0.99, F(1, 263) = 2.72, p = .10, partial eta2 = .01. However, there was a between-subjects effect, F(1, 263) = 9.83, p = .002, partial eta2 = .04, with a significant gender difference (p = .02) but no Hispanic ethnicity difference (p = .57). Finally, subscale findings for personal distress indicated no significant interaction between program type and time, Wilks’s lambda = 1.00, F(1, 263) = 0.07, p = .79. However, there was no main effect for time, Wilks’s lambda = 0.99, F(1, 263) = 1.04, p = .31. There was no between-subjects effect, F(1, 263) = 0.59, p = .44.

Discussion
Many research studies and meta-analyses (Bierman et al., 2010; Durlak et al., 2011; Sklad et al., 2012) have established that school-based SEL programs have positive outcomes for youths, including behavior, social, and emotional outcomes. Over the last decade there has been a push to create a larger base of evidence-based practices and to understand how gender of the students influences outcomes. In the present study, results indicated the effectiveness of the Connect with Kids SEL program, Social and Emotional Learning through Music and Visual Arts, which led to gains in social and emotional competences, namely social awareness and empathy and perspective taking. Results supported the first hypothesis: Students who participated in the visual arts and music intervention showed improvements in their social and emotional competences when compared with students in the comparison group.

The second hypothesis regarding gender differences on social–emotional competence was also supported. Results indicated that girls started with higher levels of SEL and their SEL increased more than for boys for both social–emotional awareness and empathy. However, boys did make significant gains in the group. This finding is consistent with most literature findings (Coelho et al., 2015; Holsen et al., 2008), which show that girls present larger gains in social–emotional wellness from SEL interventions. These results speak to the ability to move these competencies for both genders and to not separate genders for SEL interventions.

However, the third hypothesis was only partially supported. The facets of social–emotional competence that changed were primarily perspective taking and empathic concern. Perspective taking changed for the intervention group, and this tendency to spontaneously adopt the psychological point of view of others is an inherent cornerstone to social–emotional wellness. Improvement in empathic concern, which assesses feelings of sympathy and concern for unfortunate others, was also a key finding as it demonstrated that youths in the intervention were able to develop a greater ability for social awareness than those in the comparison group. It is possible that the fantasy competence that taps respondents’ tendencies to transpose themselves imaginatively into the feelings and actions of fictitious characters in books, movies, and plays, is something that takes more time to develop. Individuals’ personal distress (that is, feelings of personal anxiety and unease in tense interpersonal settings) did not significantly change. Thus future work on this program could address adding modules that specifically add to the fantasy and personal distress competencies.

Results from this study highlight the novelty of art and music as an intervention for SEL programming. Social and emotional competencies increased more among youths who participated in the Connect with Kids program than those youths in the comparison group, which was similar to other studies (Sitzer & Stockwell, 2015; Wright et al., 2013; Wright et al., 2006). Therefore, art and music created a transformative learning environment for participants. These findings add to extant literature on the power of music and its connection to building emotional and intellectual capabilities (Respress & Lutfi, 2006; Schellenberg, 2004). More research is needed to corroborate how participation in arts and music can facilitate SEL competencies.

Overall, this study allows for continued development of the Connect with Kids SEL program Social and Emotional Learning through Music and Visual Arts by including more programing on the ability of youths to transpose themselves into fantasy and handle personal feelings of anxiety and stress. Furthermore, this intervention promotes effective SEL programming specifically with high school youths. This study supports the use of a prepackaged program in increasing social awareness, empathy, and perspective taking. The results are consistent with the work on SEL programs in which a set of procedures (sequenced, active, focused, and explicit) are designed into the SEL programs, and that the programs and practices should be evaluated over time (Durlak et al., 2011).

Study Limitations
Some of the limitations of this study are a result of it being an evaluation of direct practice. It was not possible to use a randomized design, as the school did not feel that this was in the best interest of their students. Future studies should attempt to rely on randomization or further matching between intervention and comparison groups. This study was done over the course of one school year and did not collect follow-up data. Future SEL programs should be analyzed for longer periods to understand what can increase the effectiveness and how to sustain ongoing programs that are embedded into the curriculum. Finally, it would have been helpful to have teacher reports on each student assessing the students’ social–emotional competences in an effort to triangulate the self-assessments.

Conclusion
Social work services provided to teenagers and adolescents in schools could benefit from differing ways to implement SEL content. This study opens the possibility of integrating SEL content into music and arts curriculum that may be an avenue for some schools. In addition, this study was implemented in a school, using a comparison group, and this methodology could be implemented to evaluate future practices in schools without using a randomized design. Future work could evaluate how social work services could benefit from understanding the core components of SEL and implementing it in their services to targeted students in need.

Finding creative ways to improve SEL in school-based programs is essential for positive youth development. Art and music offer a unique setting through which adolescents could develop these transferable life skills as a result of these subjects’ transformative power. Moreover, it is important to find ways to incorporate SEL programming with students at different grade levels, as SEL is recommended to begin as early as preschool and continue throughout high school (CASEL, 2012). This study demonstrates promising techniques for implementing SEL with high school students. Not only did the Connect with Kids program prove to be effective with high school students in social–emotional competence, but it also furthered scholarship on school-based SEL through more rigorous program evaluation. Future studies are imperative to learning how to improve effective SEL programming through arts and music with students of all ages.
