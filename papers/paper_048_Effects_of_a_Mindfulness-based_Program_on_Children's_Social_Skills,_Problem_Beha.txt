Abstract
In studies conducted on the early childhood years in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of mindfulness-based practces in the development of
mental and physical health. Mindfulness is used to develop awareness-related skills such as atenton, concentraton, emoton regulaton, and metacogniton that
improve self-regulaton while children are aware of their experiences. In the current study, the literature was reviewed with 17 studies published between 2010 and
2022 on the efectveness of mindfulness in the self-regulaton skills of children aged 3–7. The reviewed studies were analyzed with the content analysis technique,
and the fndings were presented in themes and codes. As a result of the research, 17 studies have demonstrated that mindfulness improves children’s self-regulaton
skills and reduces negatve emotons and behavior. The studies have demonstrated that frequent use of mindfulness training in early childhood supports children’s
skills such as positve social behavior, empathy, prosocial behavior, executve functon, and emoton management and is associated with higher levels of emoton,
thought, and behavior regulaton skills. Considering the data obtained from the results, it benefts teachers and educators to make mindfulness-based programs common for children’s emoton, atenton, and behavior regulaton from an early age. Potental aspects for further research were also discussed.

Introduction
Early childhood may take time for children to learn to cope
with their emotions and thoughts. Problems in regulation skills,
such as impulsive actions, inadequate attention control, and inability to control emotions, are frequently experienced among young
children (Akman et al., 2008). However, it is expected that each
individual has the skills to manage his/her emotions and behavior.
Self-regulation is defned as the ability of children to control their
emotions, behaviors, and desires, to delay or suppress them when
necessary, to use their attention appropriately, and to obey the rules
(Aydın & Ulutas, 2017). Children, who interact with their environment, gain some experiences and can direct their internal thought
processes and external behavior to reach the goals they have set with
these experiences (Bronson, 2019). Self-regulation is the ability to
control thoughts, behaviors, actions, and attention in this process
(McClelland & Cameron, 2012). In other words, self-regulation is
individuals’ recognizing the environment they are in, regulating their
behavior in accordance with the goal they have set to adapt to the
environment they are in, determining how to communicate with their
environment to achieve their goal, and having self-awareness (Cleary
& Zimmerman, 2004). Self-regulation is the ability to control one’s
emotions, body, and attention to perform one’s functions and achieve
well-being. Self-regulation skills, which start to develop at an early
age and afect the development of the child in many aspects, develop
rapidly in the preschool period (Aksoy & Tozluduman Yaralı, 2017;
Erol & İvrendi, 2018).
Self-regulation, which develops in early childhood, is an important skill afecting children’s future lives (Karreman et al., 2006;
McClelland & Cameron, 2012). It has been determined that children
who have developed self-regulation skills are more successful in academic felds, adapt more easily to new situations they face, and adapt
more easily to other children in processing, storing, and evaluating
information (Şepitci, 2018). It has been stated that children with high
self-regulation skills are less anxious about events than other children
(Erkan & Sop, 2018). They are less depressed, more aware of how to
cope with stressful events they experience, and how they will behave
in situations that form a source of stress in the future (Buckner et al.,
2009). Also, it is seen that children with self-regulation have the skills
to initiate, maintain, and end a situation, event, or action in a planned
way, and they are individuals with strong interpersonal relationships
because they can adapt more quickly when they face diferent situations
and people (Bernier et al., 2010). Young children have a high potential to experience social and academic problems such as low levels of
self-regulation, negative behavior (e.g., aggression, impulsive behavior,
challenge), negative attitude towards school, peer rejection or exclusion (Montroy et al., 2016), poor school readiness and sense of selfesteem (Aras, 2015; McClelland et al., 2013), difculties in managing
stress (Beauregard et al., 2006). Supporting children with undeveloped
self-regulation positively afects their future academic achievement and
social competence (Aksoy & Tozduman Yaralı, 2017; Aras, 2015).
A healthy self-regulation process is of great importance for children
to become healthy individuals. Considering that self-regulation skills

are thinkable, learnable, and controllable, external support is needed to
support these skills (Çiltaş, 2011). For this reason, it is very important
to prepare appropriate environments and opportunities for children to
gain these skills during this period (McClelland & Cameron, 2012).
Preschool education is the most appropriate and efective environment for children to develop self-regulation skills and acquire positive
social-emotional behaviors and skills. For this reason, there is a need
for systematic and planned educational programs that enable children
to acquire and develop these skills from the preschool period (Liman
& Tepeli, 2017).
Mindfulness-Based Practices
Mindfulness is the practice of paying attention to young children in
a very special way. To some extent, it teaches children to develop an
awareness of themselves, others, and their environment. Mindfulness
practices, which are beginning to be a trend in school settings, are an
approach often referred to as mindfulness-based stress reduction (or
MBSR). It has emerged as a scientifcally researched approach related
to Buddhist practices built by Jon Kabat-Zinn in the late 1970s (Burke,
2009; Flores, 2016). Several programs exist that use mindfulness, such
as MBSR, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, and acceptance and commitment therapy (Burke, 2009).
These interventions usually include techniques such as breathing exercises, body scanning, meditation, and attention control (Davidson,
2010). The MBSR program can be used as a supportive, preventive,
complementary method or as a method on its own. Integrating this
capacity into our daily lives provides a resource that can be benefcial
while intensely struggling with bodily symptoms and difcult emotions. Stress is used to cope with challenging situations and emotions
(Mindfulness Institute, 2022). Limited information is available on the
efects of stress, arousal, and anxiety on young children’s ability to
control their behavior. Mindfulness-based approaches can support the
development of self-regulation by planning age-appropriate activities
that will enable children to think about their experiences while reducing anxiety and stress (Zelazo & Lyons, 2012).
Mindfulness is defned as being aware of one’s thoughts and actions
at the moment (Lawlor et al., 2014). Kabat-Zinn (2003) defned it as
the state of awareness by paying attention to the emergence of the
experience by focusing on the present moment. Mindfulness requires
only paying attention and seeing things as they are, not trying to change
things (Kabat-Zinn, 2003). Mindfulness training is a way to help children in early childhood to focus their attention, direct their attention,
regulate their behavior, and establish meaningful interpersonal relationships by being aware of their feelings and thoughts (Atalay, 2020).
The four main components behind mindfulness practice are the change
in attention regulation, awareness of emotions, body awareness, and
self-view (Tang et al., 2015). In mindfulness practices, high-level
thinking skills such as reasoning, problem-solving, and planning are
also developed in addition to using inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive fexibility skills, which are the main components of
executive function skills (Thierry et al., 2016).
In recent years, studies on preschool children have shown an
increase in the number of mindfulness-based practices that teach awareness skills to increase children’s psychological health and well-being.
Although there has been an increasing interest in practices with children and adolescents with the emergence of a small group of research
literature, interventions and research have been conducted mostly in
adult populations (Burke, 2009). Programs prepared for adults have
been adapted to the ages and development of children, and mindfulness
interventions for children have started to be included in the literature
(Bockmann & Yu, 2022). In the last decade, although limited, studies
on mindfulness have shown that mindfulness-based programs can afect
the well-being and learning of preschool children (Erwin et al., 2017).
The preschool period is considered a critical period for children’s
self-regulation development. It shows that mindfulness-based practices in children’s self-regulation development provide cognitive and
emotional awareness, reduce distraction and cognitive rigidity, and
allow for the deliberate regulation of behavior, attention, and emotion (Zelazo & Lyons, 2012). Studies have found that the inclusion
of mindfulness-based training programs in school environments positively afects children’s self-regulation (Viglas, 2015; Zimmerman,
2018), provides cognitive control and personal relaxation (SchonertReichl et al., 2015), reduces problem behaviors, and supports emotion
regulation (Willenbrink, 2018; Yıldızhan, 2019) and executive function skills (Lertladaluck et al., 2021). Many studies (Janz et al., 2019;
Zelazo & Lyons, 2012) and systematic screening, and meta-analytical
studies (Maynard et al., 2017; Zenner et al., 2014) reporting the efectiveness of mindfulness programs placed in educational environments
prove that teachers are more efective when they are involved in the
process rather than acting as external experts.
In the present study, the research results of the studies conducted
in the last 12 years investigating the efectiveness of mindfulnessbased practices in the self-regulation of early childhood children were
reviewed. This study focuses on the results of mindfulness-based practices and research conducted with children between 3 and 7 in Turkey
and the world. The distributions of the studies conducted between 2010
and 2022 were examined by considering the publication years, methods, data collection tools, and fndings. In this context, an answer was
sought to the question, “What is the efect of mindfulness-based practices on the self-regulation of children in early childhood?” In addition,
answers were sought for the following sub-problems: (a) What is the
efect of mindfulness-based practices on the emotional regulation skills
of preschool children? (b) What is mindfulness-based practices’ efect
on preschool children’s cognitive regulation skills? Finally, (c) What is
the efect of mindfulness-based practices on behavior regulation skills
of children in early childhood?
Methods
In this study, a systematic review methodology was conducted in
the international literature, which examines empirical studies refecting
the efects of mindfulness-based practices on children’s self-regulation
skills in early childhood. Systematic literature reviews are the structured and comprehensive syntheses of a large number of studies conducted with similar methods to determine the best research evidence
that can be obtained by experts in the feld (Karaçam, 2013).
Selection of Studies and Search Terms
In the study, databases were scanned using self-regulation, mindfulness, awareness, early childhood, kindergarten, and young children
keywords. Forty-fve studies were reached between 2010 and 2022.
Twenty-eight of the 45 articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria
were not included within the scope of the study. As a result, 17 studies
that met the inclusion criteria within the scope of the research were
included in the research focus. A total of 17 publications, two from the
Web of Science database, fve from the PubMed database, seven from
the Springer database, two from the Eric (The Education Resource
Information Center) database, and one from the EBSCOhost database,
were examined within the scope of the research.
Some criteria were determined for the studies included in the current study:
1. All empirical studies, including cross-sectional studies and longitudinal studies, were included in the research. Systematic review
and meta-analysis studies were excluded.
HAYEF: JOURNAL of EDUCATION

2. In the studies included in the study, the age of the children in the
primary sample group was limited to 3–7 years. As the second
sample group, the parents or teachers of children aged 3–7 were
also considered within the sample.
3. Studies with the English and Turkish language are included in the
article.
4. Studies published in peer-reviewed journals between 2010 and
2022 were included in the research.
Data Analysis
Content analysis was used in the analysis of the selected documents.
Content analysis is the systematic process used to describe the content and prepared by the researcher through coding and cataloging to
evaluate documents (Merriam, 2018). In order to categorize the studies
included in the current study and to prepare codes, examinations were
made and a “research review form” was developed by the researchers.
In line with this form developed, coding related to the study design,
sample, number of participants, data collection tools, and research
results were categorized. Studies categorized by content analysis were
grouped into themes and presented in tables. Studies meeting the inclusion criteria were coded by two independent coders. Then, the coders
met and decided on the fnal status of the themes and sub-themes. For
the reliability calculation of the study, the reliability formula proposed
by Miles and Huberman (1994) was used: Reliability=Consensus/
(Consensus+Disagreement). According to Miles and Huberman
(1994), the consensus among the coders, which is stated as internal
consistency, is expected to be at least 80%. In line with the result
obtained, the reliability of the study was found to be 87%.
Results
In this part of the study, the fndings of the research were included
to examine the research on mindfulness-based practices in the self-regulation of children aged 3–7 years; the targeted self-regulation skills,
data collection tools, and their distribution according to the descriptive
fndings for the model are presented in the studies included in the study.
Information about the publication years and focuses of the studies
examined in the study is presented in Table 1.
In the examination of Table 1, it is seen that there are mindfulnessbased practices on children’s self-regulation skills. These studies were
mostly conducted in 2013 and 2015 (n=5). Nine studies investigated
the efect on children’s emotion regulation skills, 11 examined the
efect on behavior regulation skills, and 16 studied the efect on cognitive regulation skills.
The data on the patterns used in the studies examined are given in
Table 2.
In examining the patterns used in the 17 studies, it was determined
that the most used research pattern was screening (n=11). The second
design mostly used in the studies was the quasi-experimental design
(n=4).
Information on the data collection tools used in 17 studies included
in the study is presented in Table 3.
As seen in Table 3, the efect of mindfulness-based practices on
children’s self-regulation skills was examined using evaluation, rating
and observation forms, questionnaires, interviews and observations,
and direct performance-based scales in all studies. At the same time,
it was determined that the researchers used more than one data collection tool to measure the diferent skills of the studies. It is seen in the
examination of Table 3 that the most frequently used data collection
tool in the studies is the scale (n=15). The observation was used in
seven studies, a questionnaire was used in six studies, an interview
was used in three studies, an evaluation form was used in two studies,
a rating form was used in one study, and an observation form was used
in one study.
The data on the sample size of the studies are presented in Table 4.
In examining the data on the sample size of the studies, it is seen
that most of the studies (n=10) include small samples. It was determined that there were ten studies with a sample size of 20–60, three
studies with a sample size of 60–100, one study with a sample size of
100–150, one study with a sample size of 150–200, and two studies
with a sample size of 200 and above.
Figure 1 shows that children’s self-regulation skills of mindfulnessbased practices are categorized into three sub-dimensions.
Within the scope of the study, three themes related to the targeted
self-regulation skills were formed. These themes were determined as
emotion regulation, behavior regulation, and cognitive regulation. Subthemes were prepared for each theme determined. Findings regarding
the themes and sub-themes examined within the scope of the research
are presented below.
Table 5 summarizes the information about the sub-themes and publication codes formed under the theme of emotion regulation.

In Table 5, the results of the studies (n=10) examining the efect of
mindfulness-based practices on children’s emotion regulation skills are
coded as sub-themes. Five sub-themes were formed under the theme of
emotion regulation. Studies were mostly conducted on the sub-theme
of coping with undesired emotions (n=5) and understanding emotions
(n=5). In general, studies have revealed that mindfulness-based programs increase children’s emotional awareness and develop emotional
control and empathy skills. For example, in the study coded M15, it
was determined that the children in the experimental group were better
at emotion regulation, resilience, and positive social behaviors compared to the control group by the efect of OpenMind-Korea, a conscious mindfulness-based social and emotional learning program (Kim
et al., 2020). In the study coded M5, Poelhmann-Tynan et al. (2016)
stated that children’s empathy skills improved positively in line with
the fndings obtained as a result of the pilot application of mindfulnessbased preschool activities. Thierry et al. (2016) found that students
who had the MindUP curriculum showed more improvement in social
and emotional competencies (e.g., empathy, emotional control, optimism, and positive social behaviors) compared to those in the control
groups (M3). The results of this study show that mindfulness practices
support children’s emotion regulation skills.
Information on the sub-themes and publication codes formed under
the theme of behavior regulation is shown in Table 6.
In the examination of Table 6, 11 studies examining the efect of
mindfulness-based practices on children’s behavior regulation skills
(M3, M5, M6, M7, M8, M9, M10, M12, M13, M14, M15) were found.
Seven sub-themes were formed under the theme of behavior regulation. Two studies addressing the sub-theme of delay of gratifcation,
two studies addressing the efortful control sub-theme, two studies
addressing the inhibitory control sub-theme, four studies addressing
the impulse control sub-theme, one study addressing the impulsivity
sub-theme, two studies addressing the experience orientation subtheme, and seven studies addressing the prosocial behavior sub-theme
were identifed. In the examination of the results of the study, it was
determined that mindfulness-based programs improved children’s
self-controlled behavior, positive social behavior development, delay
of gratifcation, impulse control, and inhibitory control skills. For
example, in the study coded M1 by Razza, Bergen-Cico, and Raymond
(2013), it was determined that the children in the experimental group in
the mindfulness yoga program showed improvement in terms of delay
of gratifcation, attention, and inhibitory control. In the study coded
M15, Kim et al. (2020) observed that OpenMind-Korea, a conscious
mindfulness-based social and emotional learning program, improved
the positive social behaviors of children. In the study coded M7,
Moreno-Gómez and Cejudo (2018) stated that a social and emotional
learning program (MindKinder) reduced the aggressive, hyperactive,
and destructive behaviors of children. In the study coded M6, Viglas
& Perlman (2017) found that the self-awareness-based education program improved the prosocial behaviors of their children and reduced
their hyperactivity. The study showed that mindfulness-based practices
positively afect children’s behavior regulation skills.
Table 7 summarizes the information about the sub-themes and publication codes formed under the theme of cognitive regulation.
In the examination of Table 7, the efect of mindfulness-based
programs on children’s cognitive regulation skills is categorized into
six sub-themes. It was determined that ten studies addressed the subtheme of attention regulation, seven studies addressed the sub-theme
of executive functions, four studies addressed the sub-theme of functioning memory, two studies addressing the sub-theme of executive
attention, one study addressing the sub-theme of thought awareness,
and one study addressing the sub-theme of academic performance. The
results of the study showed that mindfulness-based practices positively
afect children’s cognitive regulation skills. In the examination of the
studies, Flook, Goldberg et al. (2015) observed that the MindfulnessBased Kindness Curriculum increased the executive function and

cognitive fexibility skills of children in the study coded M2. In the
study coded M3, Thierry et al. (2016) stated that the mindfulness-based
education program improved children’s executive function skills and
positively afected their cognitive self-regulation. In the study coded
M1, Razza, Bergen-Cico & Raymond (2013) found that the attention
skills of the children in the intervention group improved in the mindful yoga program. In the study coded M12, Janz et al. (2019) stated
that mindfulness-based interventions improve children’s executive
function and attention skills. In the study coded M16, Lertladaluck,
Suppalarkbunlue et al. (2021) stated that a school-based mindfulness
program increases the working memory performance of children. All
these studies show that mindfulness practices with young children have
the potential to support the development of cognitive self-regulation
by promoting mindfulness, cognitive fexibility, inhibitory control, and
executive functions.
Discussion
In this study, the studies examining the efects of mindfulness-based
practices in early childhood, which have attracted attention in recent
years and become the subject of more research studies, on children’s
self-regulation have been analyzed through content analysis.
In the examination of the distribution of the studies by years, it is
noteworthy that only two studies were conducted between 2010 and
2015 on the subject, and it was determined that the most studies on the
subject were conducted in 2018. Since mindfulness is a relatively new
phenomenon, there has been limited research on its presence in early
childhood environments and its efects on very young children, educators, and families (Flores, 2016). Mindfulness-based programs, which
aim to provide children with exactly the skills they need to develop a
greater sense of emotional understanding and self-regulation, even in
early childhood, present important clues showing that there has been a
growing interest in recent years. It is important to emphasize the positive aspects of bringing these practices into the classroom environment,
as encouraging mindfulness in early childhood reveals many positive
results, especially for self-regulation development.
Various limitations were identifed in the studies examined. In the
examination of the national literature, it was determined that the concept
of mindfulness, which has been studied for about 10 years, is mostly
used in education and psychology, and no research examining the efect
of mindfulness-based practices on children’s self-regulation in early
childhood was found. In the international literature, it is noteworthy
that there are few studies examining the efect of mindfulness-based
education practices on children’s self-regulation. Although there has
been an increasing interest in mindfulness-based practices in Türkiye
in recent years, preliminary studies on the subject limit our comparison
of the results obtained. One of these limitations is related to the sample
size of the studies. In the examination of the studies, the sample size
of only fve includes more than 100 participants (Crooks et al., 2020;
Leyland et al., 2018; Lim & Qu, 2017; Viglas & Perlman, 2017; Zelazo
et al., 2018). It is important to ensure that programs that can be integrated into the classroom environment reach larger groups of children
by supporting them with teacher training. Li-Grining et al. (2020), in
their pilot study on the integration of classroom practices of mindfulness interventions, stated that teachers participating in training found
the awareness program applicable, while mindfulness techniques have
the potential to be included in the fow of daily life. It is also benefcial
to expand training to include parents to encourage more generalization
beyond the classroom environment.
The results obtained from the studies examined showed that
mindfulness-based practices improved children’s cognitive regulation
skills, academic performance, emotional and behavioral regulation,
and reduced outward behavioral problems. Studies have reported that
mindfulness-based practices mostly support children’s sub-skills for
coping with undesired emotions and understanding emotions on emotion regulation skills. In the examination of the studies, it is concluded
that mindfulness-based training programs improve children’s ability to
cope with undesired emotions and negative afect (Crooks et al., 2020;
Janz et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2020; Thierry et al., 2016; Zelazo et al.,
2018). The ability to cope with undesired emotions enables children to
develop a positive and healthy mental health and emotional cognition
(Bridges et al., 2004). It can support them in regulating negative emotions in positive emotions and stressful situations, coping with them
in socially appropriate ways, and achieving their goals (Shin et al.,
2023). Studies have found that mindfulness-based practices improve
children’s ability to understand emotions (Berti & Cigala, 2020; Kim
et al., 2020; Poelhmann-Tynan et al., 2016; Thierry et al., 2016; Xie
et al., 2021). In their study, Kim et al. (2020) stated that young children (3 years old) scored lower in meditation and mindfulness-based
activities. Understanding emotions is a second important element of
emotional skills, and experiences have a very important place in the
development of the ability to understand emotions, and individuals
can learn which emotion to form within events through their experiences (Sroufe, 1997). Understanding emotions, empathizing, or coping
with emotions requires a certain cognitive maturity; incorporating the
practice into daily routines and doing repetitive studies is the key to
improving awareness.
In the studies examined, it was found that mindfulness-based programs mostly focused on prosocial behavior and impulse control subskills in children’s behavior regulation skills. Prosocial behaviors are
social behaviors such as sharing, cooperating, and helping voluntarily
for the beneft of someone else and are the building blocks of children’s
development (Eisenberg et al., 2015; Sylva et al., 2020). The level of
self-regulation plays an important role in the development of prosocial behavior in early childhood. In the examination of the research
studies, it has been revealed that mindfulness-based practices increase
the development of children’s prosocial behaviors (Berti & Cigala,
2020; Kim et al., 2020; Leyland et al., 2018; Poelhmann-Tynan et al.,
2016; Viglas & Perlman, 2017; Wood et al., 2018; Thierry et al., 2016).

Sop and Hançer. Efects of Mindfulness-Based Practces on Children’s Self-Regulaton
71
Children’s self-regulation skills have been associated with better sociability (Spinrad et al., 2007) and less extroverted behavioral problems
(Haskett et al., 2012). Impulse control is the ability to inhibit the primary response to exhibit secondary dominant behavior. Impulse control contributes to regulating children’s behavior. The studies examined
revealed that mindfulness-based practices positively support children’s
impulse control skills (Crooks et al., 2020; Janz et al., 2019; MorenoGómez and Cejudo, 2019; Viglas & Perlman, 2017). Children who
come to school with impulse control skills can make it easier to sit still,
pay attention, remember and follow the rules, wait for their turn, and
fexibly evaluate new ideas (Zelazo et al., 2018). Opportunities can be
provided for children who have problems coping with stressful situations or suppressing their impulses to access short-term mindfulnessbased interventions so that they can start primary school appropriately.
It has been determined that the focus of mindfulness-based education practices in children’s cognitive regulation skills is attention regulation and executive function skills. Attention is the ability to regulate
behaviors in the face of a certain situation and constitutes a large part
of self-regulation (Rueda et al., 2011). In the studies examined in
the present study, children were asked to pay attention to their bodies, breath, sensations, and emotions in mindfulness-based practices.
When children are asked to focus their attention by noticing the factors
that distract them when they are distracted, it has been determined that
their working memory improves by keeping in mind the instructions
given to children (Flook et al., 2015; Janz et al., 2019; Lertladaluck
et al., 2021; Viglas & Pearlman, 2017; Zelazo et al., 2018). An important part of the attention regulation process is the emphasis on executive functions in the relevant literature. Executive functions refer to
cognitive processes such as attention, functioning memory, inhibitory
control skills, and their efects on planning, problem solving, and goaloriented actions (Miyake et al., 2000; Willoughby et al., 2012). The
results obtained from the studies demonstrated that mindfulness-based
practices improve children’s attention regulation skills (Crooks et al.,
2020; Flook et al., 2015; Janz et al., 2019; Lemberger-Truelove et al.,
2018; Lim & Qu, 2017; Moreno-Gómez & Cejudo, 2019; Razza et al.,
2013; Viglas & Perlman, 2017; Wood et al., 2018; Zelazo et al., 2018)
and positively afect executive function skills (Crooks et al., 2020;
Flook et al., 2015; Leyland et al., 2018; Moreno-Gómez & Cejudo,
2019; Poelhmann-Tynan et al., 2016; Thierry et al., 2016; Wood et al.,
2018). The fact that executive functions can develop at a signifcant
level thanks to behavioral and neural fexibility in early childhood
makes mindfulness practices possible in this age period (Diamond &
Lee, 2011).
Conclusion and Recommendations
The results of the present study revealed the importance of mindfulness-based programs in developing children’s self-regulation.
Also, the studies examined provided important results that mindfulness-based training practices can be successfully applied in early
childhood. For this reason, in-service training can be provided for
teachers on mindfulness training so that teachers can become experts
in this feld. Also, educational seminars can be organized for families
about mindfulness training and practices, and families can be provided with resources to help children do activities at home. It will
be benefcial to focus future program development and studies on
educating teachers about mindfulness, to support generalization outside the school environment by integrating awareness into the daily
program and classroom activities, and to provide mindfulness-based
training to parents. The results of this review suggest that teaching
mindfulness practices to young children and their caregivers can
support young children’s self-regulatory development and promote
socially and emotionally healthy environments in which this development can occur.
Although the empirical evidence is limited, there may be opportunities for children who have trouble coping with stressful situations
or suppressing their impulses to access short-term mindfulness-based
interventions to help them regulate their negative emotions and ensure
a successful transition to primary school. Studies involving young
children are very limited in the literature. However, while empirical
evidence on efectiveness in young children is limited, it is vital to
advance the feld of empirical research as it is clear that the importance
of awareness is increasing across all age groups, including children.
There is a need for new research that includes processes such as making measurements that include appropriate and comprehensive datasets
and monitoring the results in the long term. Gathering empirically solid
evidence for the feasibility and acceptability of mindfulness-based programs for children indicates that more studies are needed in the feld.
