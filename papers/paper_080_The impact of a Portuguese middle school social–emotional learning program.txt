Summary
This controlled pre–post study investigated whether a universal, school-based, social–emotional learning program implemented in two consecutive school years in two distinct cohorts, would promote gains in the social–emotional competencies of Portuguese middle school students. Moreover, it also analyzed the moderating role of students' characteristics, such as gender and baseline levels, on the impact of the intervention. Program ‘Positive Attitude’ was applied to 472 seventh to ninth grade students (25 classes). One hundred and fifty-six students in control groups (8 classes) also participated in this study. Overall, there were 628 participants aged from 11 to 17 years (Mage = 13.54; SD = 1.36). Self-report questionnaires were administered before and after the intervention. There were significant intervention gains in three (of five) social–emotional competencies, namely increases in social awareness and self-control as well as decreases in the levels of social anxiety in the first cohort. The positive effects were stably effective in the second cohort, except for social anxiety. Girls revealed greater gains in social awareness and greater reductions of the levels of social isolation and social anxiety when compared with boys. Intervention students with lower social awareness pretest scores profited more than controls. These results indicated that the intervention improved the social and emotional competencies of middle school students, supporting the cross-cultural generalization of social–emotional learning programs' efficacy.

INTRODUCTION
There is a growing number of authors supporting the notion that the current demands of society require children to be socially and emotionally competent, in order to adapt themselves to the complex demands of growth and development (Day and Koorland, 1997) and to achieve successful adult lives (Greenberg et al., 2003; Durlak et al., 2011). Since mental ill-health is one of the two most important public health problems worldwide, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of mental health promotion strategies as one of the means to achieve mental disorder prevention (World Health Organization, 2004). Therefore, the development of social and emotional competencies is an area that has been receiving increased attention in several countries (Sklad et al., 2012), with studies presenting these interventions as having the best cost/benefit ratio in the promotion of mental health (Knapp et al., 2011) by enhancing students' social, emotional and behavioral competence (Greenberg et al., 2003; Durlak et al., 2011), while simultaneously, contributing to prevent substance abuse (Tobler et al., 2000), reducing interpersonal violence and also mental health risks (Catalano et al., 2002; Greenberg et al., 2003).

The main purpose of this controlled pre–post investigation was to analyze the efficacy of a social–emotional learning (SEL) program on social–emotional competencies of Portuguese middle school students, as well as the moderating role of students' characteristics (such as gender and baseline levels) in two distinct cohorts.

SEL PROGRAMS
The SEL conceptual framework targets a combination of behaviors, emotions and cognitions, and most SEL programs are focused on universal prevention, preventing behavioral problems by promoting social–emotional competence (Zins and Elias, 2006). Payton et al. define Social and Emotional Learning as:

the process through which children and adults acquire the knowledge, attitudes, and skills to: recognize and manage their emotions; set and achieve positive goals; demonstrate caring and concern for others; establish and maintain positive relationships; make responsible decisions, and handle interpersonal situations effectively [(2008), p. 6].

A meta-analysis focused exclusively on SEL programs (Durlak et al., 2011) concluded that students (aged from 5 to 18), who had participated in universal SEL programs, improved significantly more (than control group students) in their social and emotional competencies, attitudes about self, others, and school, pro-social behaviors, and present reduced conduct and internalizing problems. The benefits are also extended to the promotion of academic performance, with reports stating an improvement of 11–17 percentile points (Payton et al., 2008). Some authors attribute this beneficial impact to socio-emotional factors being part of the most (8 of 11) influential categories that impact learning (Wang et al., 1997). The results from this meta-analysis were higher, but consistent with previous studies about universal interventions [e.g. (Catalano et al., 2002)], including studies with many of the same characteristics: inclusion of only school-based programs; implemented at least during one school semester; having pre–post assessment and control conditions; and using either design randomized trials or quasi-experimental studies (Diekstra and Gravesteijn, 2008; Payton et al., 2008).

However, the growth in number and diversity of school-based interventions creates a difficult challenge for school leaderships when they must choose the adequate program to implement, since they have limited resources and competing demands (Weissberg et al., 2003). The Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) framework (Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning, 2005) posits that successful programs must be based upon a strong research framework, possess a high level of structure (i.e. sequenced), should be delivered consistently (including a written manual specifying the conceptual model and the intervention procedures, and identifying clear and specific SEL objectives), and be carefully monitored to ensure that they are delivered as intended by their developers. They must also be developmentally and culturally appropriate, promote generalization of newly learned skills and include active forms of learning (Greenberg et al., 2003; Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning, 2005).

Despite the advances in the field some important issues still remain to be addressed in SEL research. Studies about the implementation of SEL programs have mainly been conducted in the USA (Payton et al., 2008; Durlak et al., 2011). As such, the cultural specificity renders unclear the extent to which the SEL framework is appropriate for students in other national or cultural contexts (Weare and Nind, 2011; Sklad et al., 2012). The WHO (World Health Organization, 2004) even considers that priority needs to be given to replication studies across countries. In Portugal, even though there are some school-based programs being applied, very few are based on theoretical basis and even fewer analyze their efficacy or effectiveness. Among SEL programs such analysis is even scarcer (Coelho and Figueira, 2011).

A second issue that needs to be addressed is the fact that the majority of studies analyzed in recent reviews reports about program application with elementary school students (Payton et al., 2008; Durlak et al., 2011), even though CASEL (Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning, 2005) recommends that SEL programing should be carried out from preschool to high school. An exception is a meta-analytical review of 75 recently published studies by Sklad et al. (Sklad et al., 2012) about the effects of universal, school-based social and emotional programs on social and emotional competencies, where the majority of studies (48) was conducted with secondary students. This meta-analysis concluded that these programs have beneficial effects in variables such as social skills and pro-social behavior. Intervention during middle school is crucial, like Klem and Connell (Klem and Connell, 2004) remind us, students become more disengaged from school as they progress from elementary to middle and to high school, estimating that 40–60% of high school students become chronically disengaged from school during that period. There are also programs with an established pattern of good results among elementary school students, but that lack effectiveness in middle school settings (Orpinas et al., 2000; Carroll et al., 2009). In the revision conducted by the Fundación Botín about social and emotional education experiences in several countries, the Portuguese chapter (Faria, 2011) referred only one study, regarding an intervention that took place in elementary school (Raimundo et al., 2013).

Another important issue is that there are few studies in the literature analyzing the impact of variables, like student's characteristics, that influence the effects of the programs (Payton et al., 2008) and some, such as gender or baseline levels of problems or competencies present mixed results.

Regarding gender, there are some studies reporting effects from these programs varying in accordance to gender. Farrell and Meyer reported that after the application of a program (Richmond Youth against Violence) for sixth grade students violent behavior had decreased, but only among boys (Farrell and Meyer, 1997). Similarly, Taylor et al., reporting on results of the implementation of the Reach out to Schools—Social Competency Program, also with sixth grade students, found that after the intervention boys had increased levels of self-concept while girls had developed assertiveness and reported better middle school adjustment overall (Taylor et al., 2002). A broader study conducted by the Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group (CPPRG) (Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group, 2010), involving 2937 elementary students, presented mixed results: teachers did not report differences according to gender, while peers identified a decrease in aggressiveness after the intervention, but only for boys. However, in their reviews, neither Adi et al. (Adi et al., 2007) nor Diekstra and Gravesteijn (Diekstra and Gravesteijn, 2008) concluded that there was sufficient evidence for the differential effects of gender in the effectiveness of SEL programs.

Zeidner et al. claim that program effectiveness may vary according to the preexisting levels of the competencies worked (Zeidner et al., 2002). In a meta-analysis, regarding programs for preventing or reducing aggressive behavior (of which 27% were applied in middle schools). Wilson et al. reported that higher risk youth showed greater reductions in aggressive behavior (Wilson et al., 2003). Also, two large longitudinal studies carried out by the CPPRG (Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group, 2010, 2011) evaluating the Fast Track PATHS (Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies) curriculum reported that effects were larger in early elementary students who, at baseline, showed higher baseline levels of aggression (Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group, 2010) and that intervention prevented the lifetime prevalence of all internalizing and externalizing disorders, but only among students who presented higher initial risk (Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group, 2011). However, in an evaluation study of the Second Step program among late elementary school students, Cooke et al. reported that the program was not efficient in reducing behavioral problems in students with lower levels of self-control at pretest (Cooke et al., 2007).

We hypothesized that students who participated in the program (intervention groups) would improve their levels of social and emotional competencies when compared with students in the control group, and that this improvement would be constant in both cohorts of program implementation (Hypothesis 1). We also formulate the following research questions (i) Do boys reveal more gains than girls? (ii) Do students with lower social–emotional competencies profit better?

METHOD
Research design
The research reported here reflects a quasi-experimental design as sampling was not random, and not all school and class effects could be controlled for. However, the data were being collected as part of a larger longitudinal study using a cohort-sequential design. The research design used was a 2 (intervention versus control) × 2 (preintervention versus postintervention). Owing to space constraints, the present study will only examine program effects after the implementation. Test and retest for both groups were carried out under the same conditions (by the same evaluators, with equal instructions and equivalent time differences).

Participants
Six hundred and twenty-eight (318 girls and 310 boys) seventh to ninth grade students, aged from 11 to 17 years (Mage = 13.54; SD = 1.36), from six Portuguese public middle schools from the municipality of Torres Vedras participated in this study: 472 in the intervention groups (25 classes) and 156 in the control groups (8 classes). The total number of students per class ranged between 16 and 25 (M = 19.03). The attrition rate was low: seven students (five from the intervention groups and two from the control groups) initially took part in the program and filled the pretest questionnaires changing schools before its end and six other students (from the intervention group) were excluded from the sample since they did not meet the criteria in the sincerity subscale (a result of two or higher). Schools were extremely homogeneous in terms of ethnicity (1.3% of students were Brazilian and 0.9% were Eastern European). The intervention and control groups were homogeneous in terms of gender [χ2(1) = 1.32; p > 0.05] and age [t(626) = −2.19; p > 0.01].

Procedure
The program was created as part of the municipal health promotion and risk behavior prevention plan, in partnership with three schools. In its first year of implementation, it was funded by the municipality (Torres Vedras) and Portuguese agency for the prevention of drug use (Instituto da Droga e da Toxicodependência). After 1 year of implementation, the municipality and the three other schools of the same municipality asked for the extension of the project to the remaining middle schools. So, in the second year, all six public schools elected to have the program and none were committed to other SEL programs. Meetings with schools principals and teachers were conducted in order to better understand the behavioral and social characteristics of the school, as well as school functioning. During the first year of implementation, several activities and program contents were developed and tried in order to ascertain their developmental and cultural suitability, and to create a preliminary prototype program and respective training manual (as suggested by Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning, 2005).

After the first year, more evaluation procedures were established and the sample broadened. Schools, however, did not accept to randomly assign participants to the intervention or control groups, although in the second year they agreed to establish a bigger number of control groups. These groups were chosen by matching, as much as possible, classes and schools with the same characteristics (e.g. rural versus urban, class size, grade and gender distribution).

The implementers explained the program and answered questions from parents in mandatory meetings at the beginning of the school year. Just one school chose active informed consent (and only for seventh graders), while the other five utilized passive informed consent, because the program was already part of the school curriculum, following national legislation.

Self-reports were gathered at baseline, posttest and at 6 months after the program ended (follow-up). Demographic data were recorded at pretest. The questionnaires applied to the students were administered by the psychologist who was conducting the program in the second (after a first session for presentation) and last sessions of the program. Questionnaire instructions were read out loud to the students. When needed, class directors were also asked to read the questions individually for students whose reading skills might impair their understanding of the items. If a student was not present in the class during evaluation, the questionnaires were administered in another class within a week.

Program
‘Positive Attitude’ is a universal program for middle school students (seventh to ninth grade), based upon the SEL framework proposed by CASEL (Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning, 2005) and composed by 13 weekly 45 min sessions, which take place within the same school year. It is classroom-based, infused into the school curriculum (in a discipline called Civic Formation) including all students in that class, and integrated into a multiannual project (Project ‘Positive Attitude’, since 2004) aimed at developing social and emotional competencies, specifically by increasing self-control, enhancing self and social awareness, promoting relationship skills, responsible decision-making competencies, as well as reducing social and emotional problems in students. The program is based on the notion that, just like academic competencies, social and emotional competencies require explicit instruction which may be taught and learnt in school (Zins and Elias, 2006).

The sessions are delivered by a trained psychologist, in the presence of the Class Director (responsible for the coordination of all the teachers of that class and communication with the parents). The main theoretical bases for the program are the Social Learning Theory (Bandura, 1977) and the ABCD (affective, behavioral, cognitive, dynamic) model of development (Greenberg et al., 1995). The methodologies and activities used in the construction and development of the program are described in detail in Coelho and Figueira (Coelho and Figueira, 2011). The first session is dedicated to ice-breaking activities allowing for the presentation of the psychologist, program and students. The second and last sessions are focused on the evaluation of the program. In the other 10 sessions, 2 (of 4) possible themes are developed, according to initial assessment of each class profile, and after a meeting with the Class Director. The four possible modules (five sessions each) are: self-awareness and self-management; social awareness; relationship skills and conflict management and responsible decision-making. Therefore, each unit is more explicitly focused in one or two competencies, despite the fact that all of them are developed within that unit (as recommended by Domitrovich et al., 2010). The program manual contains a detailed plan for each module, session by session, including instructions for the activities and the materials to be used, SEL learning objectives, techniques and strategies to be implemented (detailed in Coelho and Figueira, 2011).

Measures
Social and emotional competencies
Social and emotional competencies were assessed with Bateria de Socialização-3 (BAS 3; Silva and Martorell, 1989; Portuguese adaptation by Ferreira and Rocha, 2004), a self-report Spanish instrument, containing 75 items that are answered in a yes or no format. It measures five dimensions: self-control, a dimension that regards mutual respect, accepting social rules, as well as undisciplined behaviors (14 items; α = 0.78); social awareness refers to the concern for others, understanding others' feelings, establishing interactions with others, particularly with those who are rejected (14 items; α = 0.82); leadership regards the popularity and pro-activeness, capability to influence others (12 items; α = 0.73); social isolation refers to being set aside in an active or passive way, or refraining from participating in regular school events (14 items; α = 0.81); and social anxiety that regards experiencing feelings of anxiety in social situations and the capacity to deal with these feelings (14 items; α = 0.78). Higher scores of each subscale reflect higher levels of each dimension.

Program satisfaction
Program satisfaction was evaluated through a five-item (e.g. Did you like the program ‘Positive Attitude’?) self-report questionnaire (Cronbach's α = 0.87) using a 5-point scale (1 = not at all to 5 = very much) and four qualitative information questions (e.g. Would you like to participate again? Why?).

RESULTS
Preliminary analysis
Sample characteristics were appropriate for the use of parametric statistical analysis. Given the large size of the sample, significance levels were set at 0.01 for all tests. Since the dropout was very low, the attrition was not susceptible of distorting treatment effects, a situation some authors warn about [e.g. (Payton et al., 2008)]. T tests were used, for comparisons regarding initial levels of social and emotional competencies between the intervention and control groups, and between genders. No differences were found in any dimension: social awareness [t(626) = 1.20; p > 0.01]; self-control [t(626) = 0.94; p > 0.01]; leadership [t(626) = −0.62; p > 0.01]; social isolation [t(626) = −1.60; p > 0.01] and social anxiety [t(626) = −1.60; p > 0.01]. Regarding gender three dimensions presented significant differences: social awareness [t(626) = −8.62; p < 0.001]; social isolation [t(626) = 3.13; p < 0.01] and social anxiety [t(626) = −5.08; p < 0.001], with girls presenting higher levels of social awareness and social anxiety and lower levels of social isolation.

An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to explore program effects, while controlling for gender and initial levels of competence. Two-way mixed repeated measure analyses of variance (ANOVA) were employed to analyze the stability of effects by cohort (years 1 and 2 of implementation). These results are reported first since the main purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of the program, complemented by findings regarding potential differences in the program effects according to gender and on students who presented lower initial levels of competencies. The measure of effect size (ES) used was Cohen’s d for the ANCOVA and the two-way ANOVAs, following the suggestion by Payton et al. (Payton et al., 2008) an adjustment, for any previous intervention differences between the groups on each outcome measure, was made by first calculating a pre ES and then subtracting this from the obtained post ES. Partial eta-squared (ηp2) was used for the three-way ANOVAs.

Program effects on social and emotional competencies
The effect of group on posttest scores was tested using ANCOVA, with gender and previous levels of competencies as covariates. The results (summarized in Table 1, along with descriptive data) showed that after adjusting for preintervention levels and gender there was significant differences in postintervention competencies between the groups with advantages for intervention groups in social awareness, self-control and social anxiety. The effects on social isolation were close to the adopted level of significance.

Note. *p < 0.01, **p < 0.001.

Program effects by cohort on social and emotional competencies
To analyze whether there were differences in posttest mean ratings in both cohorts, a mixed 2 × 2 × 2 ANOVA was conducted with ‘time’ (pretest versus posttest) as a within-subjects factor and ‘group’ (intervention versus control) and ‘year of implementation’ (cohort 1 versus 2) as a between-subjects factors. There were no significant main effects by cohort, but there was a three-way interaction effect between time, group and year of implementation in the dimension of social anxiety [F(1, 617) = 14.05, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.022]. Additionally, there was a main effect of time in this dimension, meaning that the pattern of results was distinct between year 1 students and year 2 students. The control groups showed a non-significant increase in social anxiety in year 1 and a non-significant decrease in year 2, while the intervention groups presented a significant decrease in the levels of social anxiety in year 1 and a non-significant decrease in year 2.

Effects of student gender
We also wanted to analyze if the program had a similar pattern of results upon the social and emotional competencies of students from both genders. Three-way mixed 2 × 2 × 2 ANOVAs with ‘time’ (pretest versus posttest) as a within-subjects factor and ‘group’ (intervention versus control) and ‘gender’ (boys versus girls) as between-subjects factors showed a main effect of gender upon three dimensions: social awareness [F(1, 617) = 59.60, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.079], social isolation [F(1, 617) = 8.70, p = 0.003, ηp2 = 0.014] and social anxiety [F(1, 617) = 16.68, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.026)]. To better clarify these results, we ran separate two-way mixed 2 × 2 ANOVAs analyses (between-subjects ‘group’, within-subjects ‘time’) for each gender regarding these three dimensions. The analysis indicated that only girls from the intervention groups presented significant gains over the girls in the control groups in social awareness [F(1, 326) = 20.21, p < 0.000, d = 0.42], social isolation [F(1, 326) = 8.36, p = 0.004, d = 0.29] and social anxiety [F(1, 326) = 8.51, p = 0.004, d = 0.29], while no differences were found between boys from both groups [F(1, 291) = 5.97, p = 0.015, d = 0.31; F(1, 291) = 1.38, p = 0.24, d = 0.14; F(1, 291) = 1.94, p = 0.165, d = 0.18, respectively].

Therefore, the program significantly increased the levels of self-control for both genders when compared with the control groups, but only increased significantly social awareness and reduced social isolation and social anxiety of girls.

Effects of the program on students with lower initial levels of competencies
Another purpose of this study was to analyze whether there were differences in intervention gains among students with lower levels of competencies, namely if these would profit more from the program. For such effect, we divided the intervention groups into three groups: ‘low’, which included students in the lowest quartile of the sample for that competency; ‘middle’ students in the second and third quartiles; ‘high’ which included the students ranked in the fourth quartile. Following this procedure we conducted a mixed 2 × 2 ANOVA with ‘time’ (pretest versus posttest) as a within-subjects factor and ‘group’ (intervention versus control) as between-subjects factor among students of the ‘low’ group. Interaction effects are summarized in Table 2.

Results showed only one significant interaction effect between time and group. The students with the lowest levels of competencies benefited more from the intervention only in the dimension of social awareness.

DISCUSSION
Generally speaking, the results support the notion that the SEL program ‘Positive Attitude’ improved the social and emotional competencies of middle school students. The students, who participated in the program, when compared with students in the control groups, presented significantly bigger gains in three of the five competencies analyzed, namely increases in social awareness and self-control as well as decreases in the levels of social anxiety, as intended. Altogether, these results are consistent with the ones presented in the meta-analysis conducted by Durlak et al. (Durlak et al., 2011) which concluded that these interventions usually have significant effects on social competencies. The results support that SEL programs, with a well-defined manual including clearly defined goals, sequenced activities, that use attractive materials and employ active forms of learning, that are implemented as programmed, as well as devote sufficient time to the promotion of competencies positively impact social and emotional competencies, even if they are brief interventions, as the present one.

The results underline the importance of programs conforming to the cultural, community and developmental norms of program participants (Weissberg et al., 2003), since these aspects were subject of consideration, discussion with school personnel and assessment during the first year of implementation. It also lends some support to the notion of cross-cultural generalization of the SEL programs' efficacy, addressing the concerns raised by Sklad et al. (Sklad et al., 2012). The results reported here have additional importance because the majority of the studies included in most reviews (Diekstra and Gravesteijn, 2008; Payton et al., 2008; Durlak et al., 2011) is conducted with elementary school students.

The effects of participating in the program were stably effective during the 2 years analyzed, in increasing social awareness and self-control, and in reducing social isolation among middle school students. However, the program was only effective in reducing social anxiety in year 1. This pattern of results partly lends support to the concern expressed by the CPPRG (Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group, 2010), who warn that the additional levels of attention and resources allocated to the first year of implementation of a program may influence the results obtained.

Results also revealed that, even though intervention group students from both genders experienced gains in self-control, that was not the case for the increase in the levels of social awareness and the decrease in the levels of social isolation and social anxiety where we only found significant decreases for girls, not boys. There are different explanations for these results as girls presented higher levels of social anxiety than boys at pretest in the both groups (intervention and control), so there was more potential for improvement. This pattern of results with wider gains for girls contrasts with other studies where differential results were found according to gender (Farrell and Meyer, 1997; Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group, 2010), in which boys usually presented bigger benefits from these types of programs. It should also be taken into consideration that, in those studies, boys presented higher levels of aggressiveness at pretest, so the initial level of social anxiety might be more relevant than gender itself.

The differential gains for girls in the other two dimensions (increase in social awareness and the decrease in social isolation) are more difficult to explain as girls already presented higher levels of these competencies at pretest. The simplest explanation is that Program Positive Attitude is more appropriate for girls, another possible, but troublesome explanation is that maybe SEL programs need a certain level of initial competence in order to achieve gains. This pattern of results should be the subject of increased attention in future analysis of the program.

Another important finding was that the students with lower levels of competencies only benefited more from the intervention than the others in social awareness. This pattern of results reinforces the universal character of the program and raises the question if there should be additional units, defined according to the initial profiles of each group to better support those students with lower levels of competence. These results are similar to some other studies of universal approaches in schools, which had less effect on internalizing problems than targeted interventions (Diekstra and Gravesteijn, 2008; Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group, 2011).

The general improvement in most competencies in the intervention groups lends support to the method used to select the units developed with each group, following an adaptive approach where a set of specific pattern of needs were identified and matched with the various components of the intervention (Domitrovich et al., 2010).

Furthermore, the level of acceptance of the program ‘Positive Attitude’ by the teachers was very positive, making it possible for every group to reach the end of the program within the timeframe established. Another argument for its social validity is the high level of satisfaction with the program and its activities reported by the students. Moreover, this study also addresses the concerns raised by Carroll et al. (Carroll et al., 2009) constituting a good example of collaboration between practitioner’s work and university work, as the work started out at the practitioner level, was evaluated and originated a doctoral thesis at the university level.

Limitations
All the results were originated by self-report measures, since it was not possible to use information from different respondents. Several authors [e.g. (Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group, 2010, 2011; Wigelsworth et al., 2010)] report the advantages of triangulating information from various respondents to generate useful input and to add validity to the results reported. There is also a claim that, for many dimensions, hetero-reports are more precise than self-reports (such as Merrell, 2001). However, self-report seems to be more informative for internalized dimensions, like anxiety (Wigelsworth et al., 2010) and in studies involving older children, the results tend to be mostly reported this way (Durlak et al., 2011). The study also lacked a measure of self-awareness, in order so that we could analyze the five main competencies identified by CASEL (Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning, 2005) as the crucial social and emotional competencies.

Another limitation was that the control groups were not involved in an activity (that did not include teaching of explicit SEL competencies) during the same period of time, to counter potential placebo effects (Greenberg et al., 2003) and to annul the possibility that part of the program effects were due to the implementer characteristics.

Future directions
Bearing in mind the warning made by Greenberg et al. (Greenberg et al., 2003) that ‘short-term preventative interventions produce short-lived results’, we need to develop further research that includes follow-up analysis, including in deep qualitative data. Namely, we need to understand if those who benefit the most retain these benefits at follow-up or if they need further participation in other editions of the program in order to consolidate their improvement. Also, it would be important to analyze the extent of generalization of the improved competences to other domains or contexts, which can be achieved through the use of information from different respondents, such as teacher and parents. Larger samples would also allow us to better examine developmental differences.

There is also a need to keep tracking the results of the program during the next years to see if it is possible to obtain the results achieved in year 1, or if, as the CPPRG (Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group, 2010) warn the level of resources and attention allocated to the first year of implementation are not likely to be repeated, and as such, the results in the next years of implementation tend to wane. Along this, as the number of psychologists applying the program increases we should look how their characteristics may influence outcomes.

Another interesting future direction is the adaptation of the program to an urban setting. This would also allow to appropriately analyze the role of socio-economic status on the outcomes and to clarify the ecological validity of the strategies used when developing Program ‘Positive Attitude’.
