Abstract
This study involved a pilot examination of the impact of the Supporting Early Adolescent Learning and Social Strengths (SEALS) model on the 6th grade academic and social context following the transition to middle school. Two middle schools from a high poverty Appalachian school district were randomly assigned to the intervention and control condition. Following the SEALS training, students in the intervention school had higher peer norms for academic effort. Also, teachers in the intervention school had sustained levels of positive efficacy for meeting the instructional, behavioral, and social needs of all students while control teachers had a declining trend in their efficacy to meet students' needs across the school year. Further, compared to students in the control school, students in the intervention school with elevated levels of aggression were more likely to associate with academically productive peers and less likely to associate with peers who were identified as bullies or as victims. Implications for future research and for the development of strength-based programs for students at risk of EBD are discussed.

Early adolescence is a time of developmental vulnerability. During this period, youth experience a variety of emotional, physical, and social challenges that may negatively impact their behavioral adaptation (CitationLerner, Villarruel, & Castellino, 1999). In many school districts, this developmental period also marks the transition from elementary school to middle school.

The transition to middle school can exacerbate other developmental risks and can contribute to maladaptive behavior and poor school outcomes (CitationRoeser, Eccles, & Sameroff, 2000; CitationSeidman, Allen, Aber, Mitchell, & Feinman, 1994). CitationEccles (1999) suggested that such difficulties reflect a person-environment mismatch in which the demands of the school context are poorly aligned with the developmental needs of the student. Further, youth who have elevated levels of aggression as they begin middle school are at-risk of developing a confluence of academic, behavioral, and social problems that are linked to academic failure, delinquency, substance use, and school dropout (CitationCairns & Cairns, 1994; CitationEstell, Farmer, Irvin, et al., 2007; CitationWalker & Sprague, 1999). Such difficulties reflect a developmental science perspective, which suggests that youth develop as an integrated whole with multiple factors operating together as a correlated system (CitationCairns & Cairns, 1994).

The purpose of the current study is to examine the impact of the Supporting Early Adolescent Learning and Social Strengths (SEALS) model on the transition to middle school. Building from the convergence of developmental science and person-environment fit theoretical frameworks, the SEALS model is a multi-component universal intervention aimed at promoting productive school contexts for early adolescents. The goal is to create classroom environments in which at-risk students develop positive relationships with productive peers, view academic effort as being supported and valued classmates, and are supported by teachers who perceive themselves as being effective at promoting the productive engagement of struggling students.

THE SEALS MODEL
The SEALS model is a professional development program designed to train 6th grade teachers in strategies that foster productive classroom contexts. The program consists of three complementary interventions: Academic Engagement Enhancement, Social Dynamics Management, and Competence Enhancement Behavior Management. As depicted in Figure 1, these components are designed to have a collective, synergistic effect. Therefore, it is expected that the impact of each of the components will contribute to and support the impact of the other two components. This corresponds with the view that academic, behavioral, and social adjustment operate as a correlated system and that interventions in one domain should correspond with interventions that address correlated domains (CitationFarmer & Xie, 2007).

Academic Engagement Enhancement (AEE)
The AEE component involves providing middle school teachers with a structured format to start class and organize instruction to maintain the attention and involvement of students with learning difficulties (CitationGut et al., 2004; CitationSutherland & Farmer, 2009). Teachers are taught a variety of strategies that promote the engagement of students whom typically struggle in the classroom. These strategies include oral review, curriculum modification techniques, peer tutoring and small group activities, information processing strategies, behavioral momentum strategies, and strategies to promote engagement by systematically providing at-risk students with frequent constructive feedback and opportunities to respond. The goal is to provide a structure and format that maximizes the capabilities of teachers to be responsive to the diverse needs of students, and that promotes the engagement of students who typically have difficulty in large class and didactic instructional settings.

Competence Enhancement Behavior Management (CEBM)
The CEBM program (CitationFarmer et al., 2006) is a professional development training model that centers on proactive classroom behavior management strategies. Teachers learn to teach and reinforce appropriate classroom behavior while providing constructive consequences to reduce problem behavior. At the core of this model, teachers learn to replace punitive approaches with management techniques that support positive engagement and strengthen prosocial patterns. This model addresses seven areas of behavior management: proactive management aims and goals, establishing productive classroom routines and structures, teaching and reinforcing appropriate alternative behaviors, building supportive relationships, communicating with troubled students, using constructive discipline and natural consequences, and preventing and managing behavioral crises.

Social Dynamics Management (SDM)
SDM is an inservice training and directed-consultation model to enhance teachers' awareness of classroom social dynamics and the corresponding impact of such dynamics on students' academic engagement and classroom behavior (CitationFarmer, 2000; CitationFarmer & Xie, 2007). With this component, teachers learn to identify distinct peer groups, hierarchical social structures, and students' social roles (e.g., leaders, followers, bullies, victims, and isolates) in the peer system (see CitationSutherland & Farmer, 2009). An emphasis is placed on understanding and preventing the social dynamics of bullying and social aggression. Teachers are taught how to use this information in their daily instructional and behavior management activities, including grouping practices, peer tutoring strategies, and strategies to use peers to model and reinforce desired classroom behavior.

The delivery of the SEALS training involves two days of a traditional workshop format immediately prior to the beginning of the school year, 10 internet-based self-guided training modules, and directed consultation. The directed-consultation approach is central to this model. Directed-consultation centers on integrating a standardized intervention into the daily activities and culture of the school. This involves conducting pre-intervention observations to identify the strengths and needs of individual schools and sixth grade teams, making pre-assessments of how teams operate, and determining how to structure the training and content so it is relevant to the goals and challenges that teachers view as their mission. With this approach, teachers assume a partnership role with the intervention specialist who conducts the training. Thus, across the various training components (i.e., inservice workshops, web-based modules, directed-consultation meetings), teachers typically become highly active participants who bring “real world” examples and issues to the training content and, in so doing, readily integrate the SEALS intervention strategies into their daily instructional and classroom management activities. The directed consultation includes at least 10 team meetings that correspond with the Internet training modules. Additional team meetings are scheduled as needed (as determined by the intervention specialist) and additional individualized consultation and training may be conducted with one or more teachers on specific interventions when needed or requested.

THE CURRENT STUDY
The current study is part of a broader program of research that is being conducted to evaluate the SEALS model to support rural early adolescents in a variety of schools, including those that do and do not make a building transition from 5th to 6th grade. In a preliminary randomized control trial conducted in four rural K-8 schools in the Northern Plains, the SEALS model has been shown to enhance at-risk students' belonging and valuing of school, improve their perceptions of social risk for being bullied in school, and increase their end of year grades and standardized test scores (CitationHamm et al., 2010). Another randomized control trial was conducted in two Appalachian school districts with four middle schools and focused on 6th grade teachers' awareness of students' peer affiliations as they transitioned from elementary to middle school. As compared to teachers in the control condition, intervention teachers were more likely to accurately identify students' peer groups. In addition, when analyses were restricted to students who were involved in bullying, intervention teachers were more likely to accurately identify peer groups (Farmer, Hall, Petrin, Hamm, & Dadisman, in press).

To explore the impact of the SEALS model on the school context during the transition to middle school, the goal of the current study was to investigate whether middle schools that were randomly assigned to control and intervention conditions differed on contextual strengths. Three specific contextual factors were examined that have been shown to be related to at-risk students' adjustment during the transition to middle school: peer norms for academic effort, teachers' efficacy for addressing the academic and behavioral needs of students, and affiliations with academically productive peers and peers who are not involved in bullying (see CitationEstell, Farmer, Irvin, et al., 2007; CitationHamm & Faircloth, 2005; CitationRoeser et al., 2000).

Accordingly, this study was guided by three hypotheses. (1) Students in the intervention school would maintain more productive peer norms for academic effort as compared to students in the control school. (2) Compared to teachers in the control school, teachers in the intervention school would sustain higher levels of efficacy for meeting students' academic and behavioral needs. (3) Compared to students with elevated levels of aggression in control schools, aggressive students in intervention schools would affiliate with peers who were more academically productive and who had lower levels of involvement in bullying and victimization.

METHOD
The current study was conducted as part of an ongoing program of research aimed at promoting the school adaptation of early adolescents in a variety of rural school settings that have elevated levels of poverty. The Rural Early Adolescent Learning program (Project REAL) is a cluster randomized trial that involves 24 schools from seven states and five geographic regions (the Appalachians, the Deep South, the Midwest, the Northern Plains, and the West) that uses the SEALS model. The current study reports on a pilot randomized control trial that was conducted in two middle schools from a rural district in an Appalachian state.

Procedures
Recruitment involved sending consent letters to all parents of students in the participating schools. Consent procedures and all measures and data collection protocols were approved by a university internal review board, the central office administration of the participating districts, and ethics review panels of the participating schools.

Following a protocol that has been used with middle school students for two decades (e.g., CitationEstell, Farmer, Irvin, et al., 2007; Farmer et al., in press), data were collected in a group administration format. Consented participants were gathered in their school's cafeteria and were assigned alternating seats such that no student was directly beside or across from another student. They were informed about confidentiality and told that they were not required to participate and that they could withdraw from the study at any time. The instructions for completing the surveys and the individual survey items were read aloud by a trained administrator. Additional research staff provided mobile monitoring to assist students. Small group or individual assessments were conducted with students whom teachers identified as having reading or spelling difficulties. This was done in separate administrations that did not draw attention to the students. While students completed surveys, their teachers were asked to complete brief assessments of the participants. Teachers received financial compensation for their participation, and the children received compensation in the form of special pencils.

Sample
This study involved two cohorts of the Project REAL Appalachian sample. The total sample (Cohorts 1 and 2) consisted of 477 students (262 female) distributed across 2 middle schools and 3 time periods (5th grade spring, 6th grade fall and spring) with a participation rate of 62%. For Cohort 1 (n = 218), data were also available for the fall and spring of 7th grade. The majority of student participants were Caucasian (86.8%); smaller proportions were African American (10.3%) or other ethnic minority groups. Assignment to the treatment condition was balanced (50.1% of students). All 6th grade teachers in the intervention and control schools completed surveys about participating students. Also, teachers in Cohort 2 completed surveys pertaining to their teaching experiences (9 teachers per school, n = 18).

Measures
The measures for this study included multiple informants to address both students' and teachers' perspectives of the school context. The instruments used in these analyses come from the Project REAL teacher questionnaire, student surveys, and the social cognitive mapping procedure of the student questionnaire.

Interpersonal Competence Scale-Teacher (ICS-T)
The ICS-T is an 18-item survey using 7-point Likert scales that first period teachers completed for each participant in their class. The ICS-T yields scores on six factors including the aggression factor used in the current study that consists of three items (gets into trouble, gets into fights, argues; Cronbach's α = .84) (CitationCairns, Leung, Gest, & Cairns, 1995). The ICS-T has convergent validity with direct observation, student records (i.e., grades, discipline reports), and peer-nomination measures (e.g., CitationCairns, Leung, Gest, et al., 1995; CitationEstell et al., 2007). In addition, the ICS-T has predictive validity over an 8-year period for adjustment in late adolescence and early adulthood (CitationCairns & Cairns, 1994).

Student Peer Norms for Effort and Achievement
Peer Norms for Effort and Achievement (CitationHamm et al., 2010) is an 11-item scale that measures students' perceptions of the acceptability of achievement and effort among peer affiliates. In response to the prompt, “The kids I hang around with in school think it is good to …” students rate on a 6-point scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree) items such as “offer to help other students if you know the answer or how to solve a problem.” Cronbach's alpha for the scale for this sample is .85.

Social Cognitive Maps (SCM)
Following procedures established by Cairns (e.g., CitationCairns, Leung, Buchanan, & Cairns, 1995), participants were asked, “Are there some kids in 6th grade who hang around together a lot? Who are they?” Students were instructed to list as many groups as they could think of. Consistent with past work with SCM, students were not provided with class rosters, and peer nominations were made from free recall. Groups identified by the SCM have been validated by observational and survey data of student interactions (CitationCairns & Cairns, 1994; CitationGest, Farmer, Cairns, & Xie, 2003). Short-term test-retest reliability coefficients suggest high stability of students' peer groups, especially during the same academic year (CitationCairns, Leung, Buchanan, et al., 1995). Data from the SCM surveys were analyzed with the SCM 4.0 program for social network analyses to identify distinct peer groups within the social network. Monte Carlo style trials have indicated that the SCM procedures are robust and reliably identify peer groups in samples that have participation rates of at least 50% (CitationCairns, Leung, Buchanan, et al., 1995). For the current study, participation exceeded the 50% threshold.

Teacher Assessment of Social Adaptation
Teachers rated participating students on items regarding specific aspects of social adaptation; included in the current study were teacher ratings of students' involvement in bullying (see CitationEstell, Farmer, & Cairns, 2007). These items involve a Likert scale and have been shown to have moderate to high six month test–retest reliability coefficients (.62–.72). Teachers rated their agreement with each statement (e.g., “bullied by peers,” “bullies peers”) on a 7-point scale ranging from “Frequently” to “Never.”

Teacher Assessment of Academic Effort and Achievement
Teachers rated participants' effort and achievement on three items (CitationHamm et al., 2010): “How well does child complete his/her homework?”; “How well does child perform on curricular tests?”; and “How well does child perform on standardized tests” using a 5-point scale. Response options ranged from “Very Well” to “Not at All Well.”

Teacher Efficacy
Teachers completed a 6-item instrument adapted from the Personal Teaching Efficacy scale of the Patterns of Adaptive Learning Scales (PALS; Midgley, Maehr, & Urdan, 1993). Teachers rated their agreement with statements such as “I am good at helping all the students in my class make significant progress” on a 5-point scale, ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Cronbach's alpha for this scale was .89 for this sample of teachers.

Data Reduction
At-risk for Aggression Problems
Students were identified as at-risk for behavioral problems from the ICS-T factor scores rated by teachers in the fall of the middle school transition year. For this analysis, we obtained the mean and standard deviation of the aggression factor for each school. Students were coded as “1” for “at-risk” if their teacher rating was 0.5 standard deviation or greater above the mean score on the aggression at that school.

Characteristics of Peer Affiliates
Peer affiliates were operationalized as the members of a participant's SCM peer group. Peer affiliates average scores were calculated based on the teacher-rated scores for effort and achievement and social adaptation of each peer affiliate for each participant. A multi-step process was used in order to calculate these affiliate scores. First, a total sum for each selected variable was calculated for each peer group identified through SCM procedures, and the number of members of the peer group with non-missing data on the variable was tallied. The participant's score was next subtracted from the total group sum score. Finally, the sum of the affiliates score was divided by the number of non-missing members of the peer group subtracted by one (for the participant). This procedure was repeated for each participant.

RESULTS
Students' Peer Norms
To address the first hypothesis, we examined the extent to which students experienced a protective effect from the intervention in terms of their perceived peer group norms for effort and achievement at the end of the intervention year as well as into the school year following the intervention year. These analyses included the sample of participants for whom there were data available from pre-transition (i.e., spring of 5th grade) through the spring of 7th grade. Analyses of covariance analyses (ANCOVA), controlling for student gender and ethnicity, and baseline (fall, 6th grade) scores, were used to test for intervention versus control school differences in peer group norms at four time points: baseline, end of 6th grade, beginning of 7th grade, end of 7th grade. Adjusted means at each time point are reported in Table 1.

Mean differences were examined at the beginning of the 6th grade year to confirm that students did not evidence differences prior to full implementation of the SEALS program. Results of this ANCOVA indicated no main effect of intervention condition on perceived peer group norms at the beginning of the school year. That is, at the beginning of the school year, and with limited professional development completed by the intervention school teachers, students in intervention and control schools evidenced comparable perceived peer norms for effort and achievement (F(1, 192) = .123, ns). At baseline, girls reported more favorable peer group norms toward effort and achievement (F(1, 192) = 18.48, p = .000).

A subsequent ANCOVA was used to test the effect of the SEALS intervention on students' perceived peer group norms at the end of 6th grade. Analyses indicated significant covariate effects for baseline peer group norms, F(1, 190) = 60.05, p = .000 and for gender, F(1, 190) = 4.12, p = .02. After accounting for control variables, there was a significant main effect of intervention on students' perceived peer norms at the end of the 6th grade school year such that students whose teachers had completed the SEALS model reported more positive perceived peer norms toward effort and achievement, F(1, 190) = 6.66, p = .005.

Subsequent analyses tested for differences between students in intervention and control schools during the year following intervention (i.e., 7th grade). At this point in time, no student, in either intervention or control schools, had a teacher who had been trained through the SEALS program. First, using the fall of the 7th-grade peer norms score as the dependent variable, results of the ANCOVA indicated that of the control variables, only baseline peer group score was a significant covariate, F(1, 183) = 43.83, p = .000. Results indicated a significant main effect for intervention condition, F(1, 183) = 6.09, p = .007 such that students in intervention schools reported significantly more positive peer group norms for effort and achievement than students in control schools. A comparable ANCOVA was estimated for peer norm scores at the end of 7th grade. Baseline peer group norms remained a significant covariate, F(1, 178) = 30.02, p = .000, but no other covariates were significant. There was a trend for students in intervention compared to control schools to report more positive peer group norms, F(1, 183) = 1.65, p = .10.

Teacher Efficacy
Results from the previous analyses indicated that students in intervention schools experienced a different social environment and different social adjustment than their counterparts in control schools. To address the second hypothesis, the next set of analyses examined whether intervention and control teachers differed in terms of their teaching experiences at the end of the intervention year. ANCOVA was used to compare intervention versus control teachers' reported efficacy at the beginning of the school year, controlling for years of teaching experience. Results of the ANCOVA indicated no significant differences between intervention and control schools at this time point, F(1, 17) = .056, p = .817. ANCOVA analyses with spring scores for teacher efficacy, controlling both for teaching experience and baseline efficacy score, indicated a trend toward significance, in the difference in efficacy between intervention and control school teachers (F(1, 18) = 1.76, p = .10). No covariates were significant predictors of teacher efficacy at the end of the school year. Figure 2 displays the mean scores at each time point and demonstrates that control school teachers declined in their sense of efficacy across the school year to report nearly significantly lower scores. In contrast, intervention school teachers remained consistent in their sense of efficacy across the intervention year.

At-Risk Adolescents' Peer Affiliations
To examine the third hypothesis, the final set of analyses was restricted to participants who were identified early in the middle school transition year as at-risk for behavioral problems, based on teacher ratings of aggression (n = 43; 24 control). Dependent variables included the mean level of peer affiliates' teacher-rated effort (homework completion) and achievement (performance on curricular and standardized tests) and teacher-ratings of frequency of being bullied and bullying behavior at the beginning of the school year. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine differences by intervention status in these characteristics of peer affiliations between youth at-risk in intervention versus control schools. Prior to analysis, the proportion of social isolates for at-risk youth was examined. There were no differences in intervention and control schools at waves 2 or 3. Only 16% of at-risk students were not in peer groups at wave 3.

A first set of analyses compared the peer affiliates of at-risk youth in intervention versus control schools at the beginning of the middle school transition year (fall). Results indicated no significant differences in the peer group affiliates of at-risk youth in intervention versus control schools on any of the teacher-rated characteristics at the beginning of the transition year.

A second set of analyses for this subsample compared characteristics of the peer group affiliates at the end of the middle school transition year between the youth identified at-risk for behavioral problems at the beginning of the school year in the intervention versus control school. Dependent variables included the aggregated scores of peer affiliates based on teacher ratings for the variables used in the prior analysis, but for ratings of youth in the spring of the school year. Results of the ANOVA indicated that in intervention schools, youth identified as at-risk (elevated levels of aggression) by teachers at the beginning of the school year were affiliating with peers in the spring who were rated by teachers as generally expending greater academic effort and attaining greater achievement. Specifically, the peer affiliates of these youth in intervention schools were significantly more likely to complete homework (M = 3.58 vs. M = 3.13, F(1, 42) = 3.86, p = .03), and were rated by teachers as performing better on both curricular (M = 3.41 vs. M = 2.84, F(1, 42) = 6.56, p = .005) and standardized tests (M = 3.63 vs. M = 2.78, F(1, 42) = 14.19, p = .001). Teacher ratings also indicated that in the spring of the middle school transition year, youth identified as at-risk for behavioral problems early in the school year had peer affiliates who were both less likely to bully others (M = 1.99 vs. M = 2.89, F(1, 42) = 8.65, p = .003) and were less likely to be bullied by others (M = 1.99 vs. M = 2.89, F(1, 42) = 4.66, p = .015).

DISCUSSION
Consistent with developmental science (CitationCairns & Cairns, 1994) and person-environment fit (CitationEccles, 1999) conceptual frameworks, the findings of the current study suggest that a strength-based perspective of the education and treatment of early adolescents who are at-risk for emotional and behavioral disorders should include a focus on establishing a general context that promotes students' productive engagement as they transition into middle school. Students' academic, behavioral, and social adjustment involves ongoing transactions between teachers, students, and the climate that they collectively create and negotiate (CitationSutherland, Lewis-Palmer, Stichter, & Morgan, 2008). By teaching teachers how to link across the academic, behavioral, and social domains with instructional and classroom management strategies that evoke students' competence and that reinforce positive behaviors and strengths, the SEALS model appeared to produce a general school environment that fostered positive peer norms for academic effort, promoted behaviorally at-risk students affiliations with productive peers, and sustained teachers' efficacy for supporting students' progress across the first year of middle school.

The current work suggests that the SEALS model may help teachers promote a context in 6th grade that facilitates students' adaptation to middle school and helps them to develop or sustain academic norms and peer relationships that may enhance their behavioral adjustment. When considered in light of previous research (e.g., CitationHamm et al., 2010; Farmer et al., in press), the SEALS model shows considerable promise for supporting students' strengths during this transition period that is difficult for many youth. Reflecting the intervention aims and logic model of this program (see Figure 1), it appears that SEALS enhances teachers' understanding of the classroom social dynamics that contribute to students' adjustment (Farmer et al., in press) and helps them create an environment where students continue to value academic effort and affiliate with peers who support their positive academic and social engagement.

The promise of the SEALS model for promoting behaviorally at-risk students' adaptation and strengths during the transition to middle school must be viewed within the framework of a broader system of supports for such youth. We view this model as complementing structurally focused positive behavioral support programs (see Lewis et al., this volume). When combined with universal PBS programs, the SEALS model can serve as a Tier I intervention to support academic, behavioral, and social competencies for students during the middle school years. However, additional Tier II and III programs are needed to support the development of strengths in youth who have chronic and sustained difficulties during early adolescence (see CitationLane et al., 2007). We expect that a combination of Tier I PBS and the SEALS model may provide a strong foundation for such efforts. Additional research is needed to explore this possibility.

Limitations and Future Research Needs
Although it appears that the SEALS model has promise as a universal intervention to support the adaptation of youth as they transition into middle school, the results of the current work must be considered within the parameters of the limitations of this study. First, this research reports on a pilot investigation. While the participating schools were randomly selected to the intervention and control condition, it is possible that differences in the findings reflect differences in the samples or the characteristics of the schools. Although the schools appeared to be highly similar in terms of student and teacher characteristics, there is a need for more evidence that includes the analyses of possible nesting effects. Current research that is being conducted as part of Project REAL will yield a sample of 24 rural schools (12 intervention, 12 control) and will make it possible to include the school as a level of analysis. Second, the current sample and the samples of the broader Project REAL study are limited to rural schools. The SEALS model is designed to be responsive to a variety of school settings for early adolescence. Therefore, there is a need for additional research that examines the impact of the SEALS model in suburban and metropolitan schools. Third, as indicated above, the SEALS program is designed to be a universal model and is not intended to meet the more intensive needs of students who have chronic and severe emotional and behavioral problems. However, the SEALS model should provide a good context for the more intensive Tier II and Tier III interventions. Thus, there is a need for additional research aimed at developing more intensive individualized interventions that build from the strength-based context established by the SEALS program.

In conclusion, the current study highlights the importance of viewing the school context from a strength-based perspective. Often, when we think about interventions the focus is on the individual child and ameliorating her or his deficit or problematic behavior. The current model suggests that we must recognize that teachers simultaneously work with academic, behavioral, and social factors that contribute to students' school adjustment and that they are also managing the broader ecology of the classroom and the general climate of the school. By systematically developing interventions that work across the academic, behavioral, and social domains, it may be possible to establish models that are responsive to the complex tasks that teachers do as they manage the instructional and behavioral context of the classroom. The SEALS model shows promise on this front and may help teachers create contexts that support students' development of new strengths and competency as they encounter the challenges of middle school.
