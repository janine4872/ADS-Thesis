Abstract
Significant research has been conducted on skills’ enhancement school programs, since their importance has been well established. The presented study evaluates “Steps for life”, a Greek, universal, annual, teacher-taught programme, designed to improve personal and social skills
in young elementary students by the use of questions, diffusion in formal and hidden curriculum, and parental involvement. The experimental
study was conducted in Greece during 2013-2014. The sample consisted of 2439 students, with 1516 forming the experimental group and
923 the control group. The study questionnaire included demographics, Personal and Social Skills Scale-Elementary, and the BASE scale. It
investigated students’ self-esteem, concentration of attention, participation/cooperation, emotions’ identification and expression, emotions’
management, ability to control verbal and physical aggressiveness, ability to control victimization, empathy, friendship skills, problem-solving,
ability to take responsibility, and use of spoken and written language. The experimental group exhibited significant improvement in all investigated skills post-intervention, while the control group did not improve concentration of attention, emotions’ management, and their ability
to control verbal and physical aggressiveness and victimization. The analysis also revealed that intervention students had significantly higher
improvement than the controls in all dimensions. Appropriately designed mental health promotion programs can improve several children’s
social-emotional skills and abilities.

Introduction
It has almost been forty years since Gilbert Botvin (1979)
created the first life skills school programme and paved the
way for social and emotional evidence-based skill’s education. Since then, the differences between the closely linked
and often overlapping approaches of prevention and mental
health education and promotion have been clarified, with the
distinction between them laying in their targeted outcome
(WHO, 2002): Prevention, having to do with the causes of
disease (Herrman, Saxena, Moodie & World Health Organization, 2005) aims to help in the avoidance of problems or
the reduction of symptoms related to mental health (WHO,
2002), and mental health promotion, having to do with the
determinants of mental health (Herrman, Saxena, Moodie &
World Health Organization, 2005), is a process of empowering individuals in increasing control over their mental health
and the factors that determine it (WHO, 2004a).
Also, since then, several mental health-related school programmes have been well-recognized, either categorized as
Life Skills (LS), Skills for Life (SFL), Personal and Social Skills,
and Social and Emotional Skills (SES), or labeled as Prevention, or Social Emotional Learning (SEL) programmes. Whatever their title and specific goals, or even their theoretical
basis, one cannot help but admit that this kind of education
has produced impressive outcomes during the past decades
concerning the improvement of students’ social, emotional,
and coping skills, as pointed out by international organizations (UNESCO, 2004; WHO, 2003) and shown by various
meta-analyses (Durlak, Weissberg, Dymnicki, Taylor & Schellinger, 2011; Diekstra & Gravesteijn, 2008; Payton et al., 2008;
Wilson, Gottfredson & Najaka, 2001; Durlak & Wells, 1997).
Such programmes have been found to a) improve self-esteem (O’Mara, Marsh, Craven & Debus, 2006; Haney & Durlac, 1998), b) prevent depression (Merry, McDowell, Hetrick,
Bir & Muller, 2004; Forness, Serna, Kavale & Nielsen, 1998)
and other mental health problems (Greenberg, Domitrovich, & Bumbarger, 2001), c) prevent drug use (Faggiano et
al. 2005; Tobler et al., 2000) and alcohol and tobacco use
(Botvin, Griffin, Paul, & Macaulay, 2003), d) enhance emotion management and self-control (Gansle, 2005; Barrett,
2004; Kusché & Greenberg, 1994), e) help children resolve
interpersonal conflicts (Geller, 1999; Grossman et al., 1997;
Kusché & Greenberg, 1994; Shure & Spivack, 1982) and maintain healthy relationships (Beelmann & Lösel, 2006; Englander-Golden, Jackson, Crane, Schwarzkopf & Lyle, 1989) and e)
reduce violent behavior (Hahn et al., 2007; Wilson & Lipsey,
2007; Wilson, Lipsey & Derzon, 2003; Catalano, Berglund,
Ryan, Lonczak, & Hawkins, 2004).
However, despite all the attention and the plethora of such
programmes, WHO (2010) acknowledged the fact that “the
vast majority of studies have been done in high-income
countries, with the evidence base dominated by studies in
the United States.” (p. 30), and urged researchers to con-

duct studies in “different settings, particularly in low-and
middle-income countries” (p.30). Greece does consist a
different setting, especially due to its economic situation;
though it is not officially defined as a low or even a middle
income country, its economy has declined substantially
since the beginning of an economic crisis which became
apparent in 2009, leading to unemployment, poverty,
and major cut-downs in health and education sectors’ financing. In this country, research concerning prevention
and social-emotional education in elementary school is
extremely limited; there are but a very few effectiveness
evaluation studies, to our knowledge: a) a study of a conflict control programme with structured activities named
“You and I become WE” which was found to improve social
skills in fifth and sixth graders (Chiementi & Triliva, 1994)
and is no longer available for teachers to implement, b)
a presentation of four briefly described studies on intervention programmes which were designed by the Center
for Research and Practice of School Psychology of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and found
to promote resilience, well-being, academic achievement
and positive climate in the school setting (Hatzichristou &
Lianos, 2016), c) a study of a programme found to tackle
racism in students of second to fifth grade (Triliva, Anagnostopoulou, & Vleioras, 2014), d) a study of a programme
integrating life skills in a sports context which was found
to enhance life skills in fifth and sixth graders (Papacharisis, Goudas, Danish, & Theodorakis, 2005), and e) an
evaluation study of a pilot and rather concise curriculum
named “School and Social Life” which was created under
the auspices of the Greek Paedagogical Institute (renamed
to Greek Educational Policy Institute), -was officially implemented nationally in specific schools only during the
school-years of 2011-12 until 2015-16, and was found to
improve students’ emotional intelligence and academic
performance (Babalis, Tsoli, Artikis, Mylonakou-Keke, &
Xanthakou, 2013).
The presented study examines the effectiveness of the
elementary version of “Steps for life” –a Greek, universal, teacher-taught mental health promotion school programme for first and second grade students – which was
designed having taken into account: a) the above mentioned WHO prompts, b) the fact that the Greek Official
Curriculum declares all students’ social and emotional
development as one of its main goals (Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs 2003a; Ministry of Education
and Religious Affairs, 2003b) but does not provide tools
to help the teachers achieve it, c) that Greek Paedagogical
University Departments (4 years of undergraduate studies
in order to get a degree as a teacher) do not include social-emotional education as a subject and therefore teachers do not know how to teach it, and d) that no evaluated
structured curricula exist for social-emotional skills’ enhancement in elementary students of the first and second
grades. We designed and conducted the presented experimental study, in order to identify a school-based approach
which would improve Greek students’ personal and social
skills. We hypothesized that the students who would attend the “Steps for life” programme for one school-year,
would have greater improvement compared to the ones
who would attend the existing formal Greek curriculum
concerning the taught, targeted and investigated skills: i)
concentration of attention, ii) participation/cooperation in
class, iii) emotions’ identification and expression, iv) emotions’ management, v) ability to control verbal and physical aggressiveness, vi) ability to control victimization, vii)
empathy, viii) friendship skills, ix) problem-solving ability,
x) ability to take responsibility, and xii) use of spoken and
written language,
The “Steps for Life” Curriculum
Aim and theoretical basis of the programme
The “Steps for Life” Elementary- aims to enhance first
and second grade students’ self-esteem, empathy, and
personal and social skills, with an emphasis on emotion
management and problem-solving. The programme does
not intend to teach the children ‘what to do’ or ‘how to
behave’, since it refrains from didacticism. Instead, by the
almost sole use of questions during teaching, it guides the
students in learning how to think for themselves, in order
to reach their own conclusions and find their own solutions to their everyday problems.
“Steps for Life” Elementary-curriculum was created having taken into consideration the teaching and learning
conditions in Greek Schools, the official Greek Elementary
School Curriculum, and the knowledge offered by various
SES and SEL programmes, approved by WHO and SAMHSA
(e.g. Barrett, 2004; Committee for Children, 2002; Shure,
2000; Botvin, 1998; Kusché & Greenberg, 1994; TACADE/
Lions, 1990; Borba, 1989), but cannot be described as culturally specific. The programme was designed in order
to be implemented within “The Flexible Zone”, which, according to the Greek educational system, is a weekly two
hour period, during which Greek teachers can voluntarily
choose to teach “Health Education”, “Environmental Education”, or “Cultural Education” (Ministry of Education
and Religious Affairs 2003a; Ministry of Education and
Religious Affairs, 2003b). “Steps for Life” is currently being
implemented in several elementary classes throughout
the country within the context of Health Education, after
having been approved by the Greek Ministry of Education
(Φ.14/816/171442/Γ1/12-11-2013 and Φ.14/820/ 211037/
Δ1/24-12-2014).
Concerning its theoretical background, it combines several important elements and strategies from different
approaches: As a mental health education programme,
which includes a) role-modelling of the taught skills during the “hidden curriculum” (conveyance of norms which
occurrs outside formal lessons) on the part of the teacher,
and b) the student’s attempt by role-playing, it draws from
Bandura’s Social Learning Theory (Bandura, 1997). The
importance of adults’ role-modelling in issues that concern health and mental health education has been well
documented (e.g. Hills, King, & Armstrong, 2007; Brown
& Ogden, 2004; Meichenbaum, 1977; Mize & Ladd, 1990),
since children have been found to prefer to imitate a behavior they see executed, rather than obey verbal suggestions. Role-playing has also been long found to be quiet
effective in change of behavior and in empathy enhancement (e.g. Gerdes, Segal, Jackson & Mullins, 2011; Culbertson, 1957; Staub, 1971; Clore, & Jeffery, 1972). “Through
engaging in roleplay, one may obtain insight into himself,
may be able to learn to control his feelings or to develop
new life skills”, as Corsini states in “Role Playing in Psychotherapy” (p. 6, 2017).
As a programme almost solely taught by the use of questions, encouraging children to think and express their
opinions and guiding them to problem-solve by estimating
consequences, it also draws from the cognitive approach
of Arend, Gove and Sroufe (1979) and from Shure and Spivack’s work (1982), which was found to produce positive
results in the enhancement of children’s problem-solving
ability (Shure & Spivack, 2008). More analytically this particular approach prompts children to problem solve by
helping them to adopt a certain way of thinking through a
problem: a) problem recognition (What is the problem exactly? How/when/where,/why did it occur? Are things the
Students Psychosocial / Kourmousi, Markogiannakis, Tzavara, Kounenou, Mandrikas, Christopoulou & Koutras
537
way they look?), b) solution finding (How many solutions
can be thought of?), c) estimation of consequences (What
might happen in case of each solution?), d) choice of best
solution (So which would be the best idea?), e) solution’s
execution planning (How can the idea be implemented?).
As a programme which seeks to alter student’s ways of
thinking and acting by changing teachers’ and parents’
approaches, it borrows from the Eco-Behavioral Systems
Model (Weissberg, Caplan, Sivo, 1989). In anly case, mental
health promotion school programmes have been found to
be more effective when involving elements of parents’ and
teachers’ relevant training (WHO, 2005).
As a programme which encourages students to explore
their emotions - and motives and learn through the process of pleasant discovery, it incorporates elements from
the Psychoanalytic Theory (Cho, 2009; Britzman, 1998).
Other researchers have found those elements to be effective in the evaluation of similar programs (e.g. Kusché,
2002).
Finally, but as importantly, as a programme which requires the unconditional acceptance of the students by
their teachers, and the use of active listening in order to
encourage children to find their own solutions to their
problems, it also draws from Carl Rogers’ person-centered
humanistic approach (1998). Evidence has shown that
educators’ empathy positively contributes to students’
learning and performance (Roorda, Koomen, Spilt, & Oort,
2011) and that the use of active listening is quite important
in effective teacher-parents’ communication (Lasky, 2000)
– which is essential in skills development programmes
–, as well as in teachers’ own communicative skills McNaughton, Hamlin, McCarthy, Head-Reeves, & Schreiner,
2008).The programme also builds on a structured model
for emotional education, initially introduced by the “Steps
for Life” K-curriculum, which is a programme designed for
younger children aged 4-6 years, and which also teaches
personal and social skills with emphasis to main emotions’
management (Kourmousi, Salagianni, Merakou, Tzavara, &
Koutras, 2017; Kourmousi, 2012). Specifically, a nine step
question-based procedure included in the “Steps for Life”
Elementary-curriculum described below ensures even difficult and complicated emotions’ teaching in a safe way.
The procedure could be characterized as mainly cognitive,
since it is question-based, with a psychoanalytic perspective at the point where it encourages children to explore
their experienced emotions
Table 1. “Steps for Life” Elementary-curriculum 9 steps procedure for safe emotions’ teaching in elementary students
Indicative Questions
1. Naming the emotion
How do you think the child
in this picture feels? What
is the name of the emotion?
2. External recognition
How can you tell what he/
she feels? How are the
eyes, the eyebrows, the
arms, the body posture,
the color of the face, etc.?
3. Internal recognition
Do you remember a time
when you also felt … (emotion’s name)? What did it
feel like inside your body?
(e.g. changes in heart rate,
in breathing, etc.)
4. Stages of emotion
How do we say it when we
feel just a little bit of that
emotion? How about when
it grows? How about when
it is really strong?
5. Causes of emotion
What things usually make
you feel … (emotion’s
name)?
6. Causes of emotion in
other people
What things do you think
that would make a mom
feel … (emotion’s name)?
How about a teacher? How
about a kindergartner?
How about a policeman?
How about a young refugee? etc.
7.Usual ways of reacting /
expressing the emotion
What do you usually do
when you feel … (emotion’s name)? (Teacher
writes down all the given
answers without criticism).
8.Estimation of the consequences of the reported
behaviors
(After having noted all the
given answers teacher
guides the students to estimate the consequences
of each one) What would
possibly happen if you
choose to do the first thing
that you mentioned? (He/
she then notes the most
agreed upon answer next
to the reported idea and
goes on) Would that make
the emotion of … get any
better?
9.Chosing the best ideas
(After having repeated the
same procedure for each
given way of reacting to
the emotion) So, which behaviors do you think would
be good ideas in order to
express and handle our
emotion? Should we write
them down separately on
a poster paper and/or put
it on the classroom wall in
order to be reminded in
case we need to?
Curriculum description
The “Steps for Life” elementary curriculum consists of: a)
the Teacher’s Manual containing the theoretical basis of
the programme and specific instructions for its implementation, b) the structured and analytical Lesson Guide which
also ensures an easy implementation, c) two hand-puppets – a boy and a girl students – used to introduce most
of the lessons and demonstrate the taught skills, d) 76
pictures which serve for the introduction of the subject in
most lessons, and e) the Letters to the Family which inform
parents of the taught skills and provide them with simple
guidelines and indicative ways of dialoguing, thus supporting the continuation of the child’s learning at home.
The “Steps for Life” annual universal elementary curriculum consists of 27 two-hour weekly lessons, taught in a
circle class arrangement, and divided into four modules:
a) rule-setting and establishment of a good classroom
climate, b) instruction of basic concepts, c) empathy and
emotions’ identification and management and d) prob-

lem-solving and target-setting. Each lesson includes: i)
the new concept, ii) the lesson goals, iii) the teaching instructions, iv) the needed materials, v) the introduction
of the concept by puppet scenarios or by pictures vi) the
discussion which contains all the questions which need to
be asked, vii) the role-playing scenarios, viii) coursework
activities, ix) suggested ways to transfer knowledge in the
formal curriculum, x) suggested ways for the dissemination of the taught skills in the hidden curriculum (e.g. during free-activity time, break-time, and lunch time), and xi)
the letter to the family, which describes the newly taught
skills and includes suggestions and instructions for the
consolidation of learning.
Method
Research Design and Sampling Procedure
The evaluation study took place in the school-year of 2013-
14 in six Primary Education Districts of Attica – namely the
prefecture in which Greece’s capital, Athens, is located –,
under the supervision of the University of Ioannina with
the cooperation and support of the six District School
Counselors in charge. The participating Primary Education
Districts consisted of urban, rural, and even industrial areas, thus representing all area types. Furthermore, they
also consisted of high, middle and low income areas, further strengthening the repreresentativeness of the sample.
The research design was experimental. Since the intervention aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a universal
programme whole classes and not students had to be randomly assigned in the experimental and control groups.
Thus, regarding the sampling procedure, each School
Counselor provided a list of willing to participate in the
intervention first and second grade teachers from his/her
district and conducted a draw between them in order to
assign their students randomly in the experimental and
control groups. A larger number of experimental group
teachers was chosen, trying to ensure a large number even
in case of possible dropouts. Control group teachers were
promised that they would receive gratis both the curriculum package and the training during the next school year,
while the experimental group teachers would be granted
the material and the training during the year of the study.
The draw identified seventy first and second grade teachers who became the experimental group’s teachers. Forty-three colleagues of theirs became the control group’s
teachers, since 7 of the 50 ones who had initially been randomly assigned to that group dropped out during the pre
and post intervention questionnaire completion, due to
the time consuming procedure of completing one lengthy
questionnaire for each of their students, as they reported
Sample Size and Participant characteristics
The sample consisted of 2 439 first and second grade students, 1 516 of which belonged to the intervention group
and 923 to the control group. Sample characteristics of
both study groups are presented in table 2.

The proportion of boys was 51% in the control group and
50.6% in the intervention one (p= 0.823). Both groups
consisted mostly of Greek students (88.7% in the control
group and 90.2% in the intervention group). Children’s age
was similar in both groups, with the proportion of second
graders being slightly larger than the one of the first graders. The majority of the children in both groups attended
the classic-hour (8.30 a.m.-1.30 p.m.) course, as opposed
to the full time one which operates from 7.30 a.m. to 4.00
p.m. Father’s and mother’s educational level as well as the
number of siblings were similar in both groups, as was the
living situation, since most children lived with both of their
parents (89.6% for the controls and 88.3% for the intervention group). Additionally, the proportion of those attending an integration class or receiving parallel support
(thus students with special education needs), as well as
the proportion of ones re-attending the same grade, were
similar among the two groups. Also similar was the mean
number of students in class. No intervention and control
classes were in the same school.
Facilitators’ Training
The experimental group’s teachers became the facilitators of the curriculum. This practice is common regarding
school-based prevention programmes, as reported in meta-analyses (e.g. Durlak et al., 2011; Diekstra & Gravesteijn,
2008). In order to be trained, the intervention teachers
attended: a) an initial presentation of the programme,
during which the curriculum’s guidelines and components
were analytically presented to them, b) three whole-day
bi-monthly experiential workshops, during which they
were trained mostly in modeling and transferring the programme’s skills in the hidden curriculum and c) monthly
three-hour afternoon meetings with the coordinators,
which provided them support throughout the implementation of the programme but also helped the researchers
get feedback concerning implementation fidelity. The control group teachers did not receive any training.
Implementation and Implementation Fidelity
The experimental students attended the curriculum’s
structured two-hour lessons once a week, facilitated by
their teachers. They also attended activities realized during dissemination in both the formal and hidden curriculum, throughout the week. At the same time, during the
lessons that required so, their families received the programme’s letters which contained guidelines concerning
the continuation of learning of the taught skills.
Concerning the intervention’s implementation fidelity, it
should be stressed that the “Steps for Life” curriculum has
the following characteristics which reinforce it:
1. Detailed implementation instructions are emphasized in the curriculum’s Teacher’s Manual.
2. Explicit guidelines included in the Lesson Guide
describe the implementation of each lesson. Moreover, all the questions which the teacher has to ask
his/her students, together with the indicative ways
of dialoguing and the appropriate encouragement
expressions for use during the course and during
the hidden curriculum, are provided in the curriculum, fully formulated.
3. Every lesson of the “Steps for Life” curriculum
is based on the knowledge acquired by the previous one; therefore it is practically impossible to
implement lessons or activities randomly, without
following the curriculum’s proposed sequence.
Apart from the programme’s characteristics, the following measures – similar to ones used in relevant studies
(Brackett et al., 2012; Mishara & Ystgaard, 2006; Flannery
et al., 2003) – were taken in order to ensure implementation fidelity:
1. Clear and detailed implementation instructions were analytically discussed during the programme’s initial presentation.
2. Experimental group’s teachers had to complete
an implementation and evaluation form after the
completion of each lesson-teaching. The form,
apart from questions concerning the students’
concentration and interest, also asked the teachers to note the exact activities proposed by the
Lesson Guide that they had realized and to describe any possible differences between the lesson as presented in the curriculum and the way it
was carried out.
3. The six District School Counselors, who supervised the conduct of the study, visited their intervention schools on a weekly basis during the whole
school-year, in order to inspect the implementation procedure, ensuring that the programme was
taught as designed.

Measures
The measure used to assess the intervention effectiveness
was a questionnaire comprising a) questions which included demographics (sex, age, nationality, etc.), family information (e.g. if the child lived with both his parents in the
same house, number of siblings, etc.) and school factors
(e.g. if the student attended special education structures
like an integration class or like having parallel support, etc.)
b) the Personal and Social Skills Scale for Elementary Students Aged 7-9 (Kourmousi et al., 2017) which is designed
to measure elementary students’ personal and social skills
in the school environment, and c) the Behavioral Academic Self-Esteem Scale (BASE) (Coopersmith & Gilberts, 1982)
which assesses students’ self-esteem as exhibited by their
behaviors in the school environment.
The Personal and Social Skills Scale for Elementary Students Aged 7-9 (Kourmousi et al., 2017) comprises 95
items which fall into eleven subscales, namely i) concentration of attention, ii) participation/cooperation in class,
iii) emotions’ identification and expression, iv) emotions’
management, v) ability to control verbal and physical aggressiveness, vi) ability to control victimization, vii) empathy, viii) friendship skills, ix) problem-solving ability, x) ability to take responsibility, and xii) use of spoken and written
language. It assesses the corresponding skills by examining the frequency of students’ behaviors, as observed
and rated by their teachers, with the use of a 7-point Likert-type scale, with answers ranging from 1=never or almost never, to 7= always or almost always. The scale was
found to be a reliable and valid instrument for measuring
Greek elementary students’ personal and social skills, with
acceptable Cronbach’s alpha for all its subscales ranging
from 0.82 to 0.92 (Kourmousi et al., 2017).
The BASE Scale (Coopersmith & Gilberts, 1982) is also
teacher-rated. It assesses students’ self-esteem on the
basis of the frequency of their behaviors, using a 5 point
Likert scale ranging from 1=always to 5=never. It includes
16 items, which fall in five factors: student initiative, social
attention, success/failure, social attraction, and self-confidence. The scale has been translated and adapted in
Greek by Kakouros & Maniadaki (2002).
Ethical considerations
The study questionnaire was anonymous. Permission to
administer it to the teachers was granted by the Greek Institute of Educational Policy (Ref. Φ15/806/174250/Γ1/18-
11-2013). Written consensus from each participating student’s parents was collected prior to the completion of the
corresponding questionnaire.
The study questionnaire was administered to both groups’
teachers for completion before the intervention, with instructions to be completed within a week. The study
questionnaire was also administered to all educators one
month after the intervention completion, with the same as
the above mentioned instructions.
Results
Statistics and Data Analysis
Quantitative variables were expressed as mean values
(SD), while qualitative variables were expressed as absolute and relative frequencies. For the comparison of proportions chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests were used.
Continuous variables were tested for normality using
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov criterion. Student’s t-tests were
computed for the comparison of mean values. Repeated
measurements analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to evaluate the changes observed in the questionnaire
dimensions between the two study groups before and after the intervention. In order to control for effect of demographic data and school related characteristics a series of
multiple linear regression analyses were conducted with
dependent the change in each questionnaire dimension
and independent variable the type of group (intervention
vs. control), after adjusting for gender, nationality, age,
father’s and mother’s educational level, living with both
parents, number of siblings, attendance of an integration class or having parallel support, re-attendance of the
same grade, school-hours (classic or all-day course), and
number of students. Adjusted regression coefficients (β)
with standard errors (SE) were computed from the results
of the linear regression analyses. Diagnostics for regression models were performed to check if the conditions
for regression had been met with the residuals of each
model being normally distributed and their variance being
constant. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to
explore the association between changes in dimensions
of the questionnaire. All reported p values are two-tailed.
Statistical significance was set at p< .05 and analyses were
conducted using SPSS for Windows (Version 19.0. Armonk,
NY: IBM Corp.).
Changes in Questionnaire Dimensions
Changes in questionnaire dimensions after the intervention completion for the two study groups are presented
in table 3. At baseline, the control and intervention groups
had similar scores on all dimensions. After the intervention, the experimental group students had significantly
higher scores in all dimensions. The control group significantly improved most dimensions but did not perform

Discussion
The purpose of the presented study was to evaluate the
effectiveness of “Steps for Life” Elementary Programme on
students’ personal and social skills as depicted in Personal
and Social Skills Scale for Elementary Students Aged 7-9
(Kourmousi et al., 2017), and also on their self-esteem by
the use of the BASE scale (Coopersmith & Gilberts, 1982).
All our hypotheses were confirmed.
At baseline both groups had similar scores in all investigated dimensions. Their post intervention scores revealed
that the experimental group significantly improved all the
targeted skills while the control one significantly improved
their self-esteem, their participation/cooperation in class,
their emotions’ identification and expression, their friendship skills, their problem-solving ability, their ability to
take responsibility, and their use of spoken and written
language, but did not improve their concentration of attention, their emotions’ management, their ability to control verbal and physical aggressiveness, and their ability
to control victimization. This probably indicates that either
the natural maturation and/or the Greek school regular
curriculum possibly contribute to the first skills’ improvement in students, but do not do much for the second ones.

The degree of the improved skills’ change was also found
to differ significantly between the two groups, with the
intervention group exhibiting higher improvement in all
dimensions. Analytically, regarding each targeted skill,
our results lead as to the following comparisons and comments:
Self-esteem is a trait widely targeted in social-emotional
learning programmes. Focusing on self-esteem is considered a core element of mental health promotion, as Mann,
Hosman, Schaalma and De Vries state (2004).In our study,
the experimental-group students exhibited significantly
higher improvement in it post intervention. Our finding
confirmed the findings of “Steps for Life” K-Programme
evaluation study (Kourmousi, Salagianni, Merakou, Tzavara, & Koutras, 2017; Kourmousi, 2012), as well as those
of several other researchers (e.g. Ghilay, & Ghilay, 2015;
O’Mara et al., 2006; Haney & Durlac, 1998; Elias, Gara,
Schuyler, Branden-Muller & Sayette, 1991) who concluded that self-esteem can be significantly improved through
social-emotional skills’ enhancement interventions. In any
case, we believe that when knowledge is produced by the
student, which is the situation in the above mentioned
programme, he/she results in feeling self-efficient; research has shown that cognitive-behavioural approaches
change self-esteem in children and adolescents (Haney &
Durlak, 1998). However, unconditional positive regard and
empathy, namely the humanistic approach elements of
the programme, also encourage positive self-regard (Kahn
& Rachman, 2000).Concentration of attention – a skill not
commonly targeted in similar interventions – improved
significantly higher in our intervention group. Although we
did not come upon such a finding in other studies, the previous research of the effectiveness of the “Steps for Life”
K-Programme (Kourmousi, Salagianni, Merakou, Tzavara,
& Koutras, 2017; Kourmousi, 2012) confirms the fact that
this programme enhances the skill of concentration, possibly because a whole lesson is devoted to it and/or also
because of the dissemination of the learning in the formal
and hidden curriculum, where every real-life distraction
is viewed as an opportunity for practice; besides, attempt
and repetition are proposed by the social learning theory
(Bandura, 1997) as important determinants of learning.
Participation and cooperation of the students during
class was significantly more improved in the experimental group students, corroborating the finding of the study
on “Steps for Life” K-Programme effectiveness (Kourmousi, Salagianni, Merakou, Tzavara, & Koutras, 2017; Kourmousi, 2012). Our search of the existing literature did not
reveal similar results of other such interventions, since
participation and cooperation do not seem to constitute
targeted skills of theirs. However, several studies and meta-analyses have shown interventions’ positive impact on
students’ academic achievements in general (Ashdown &
Bernard, 2012; Brackett, Rivers, Reyes & Salovey, 2012;
Diekstra & Gravesteijn, 2008; Durlak et al., 2011; Payton et
al., 2008; Zins, 2004; NRCIM, 2000). Again, observation and
imitation, which are proposed by the social learning theory (Bandura, 1997) as important learning factors, could be
the cause of the change.
Emotions’ identification and expression, as well as emotions’ management were higher improved in the intervention students, a finding also observed in the “Steps for Life”
K-Programme effectiveness study (Kourmousi, Salagianni,
Merakou, Tzavara, & Koutras, 2017; Kourmousi, 2012).
These skills, however, seem to be widely targeted by the
majority of similar interventions, most of which appear to
achieve their goals (e.g. Domitrovich, Cortes & Greenberg,
2007; Gansle, 2005; Hawkins, Smith & Catalano, 2004).
Psychoanalytic elements help support emotions’ identification (Cho, 2009; Kusché, 2002; Britzman, 1998) while
cognitive ones help in emotional management (Nelis,
Quoidbach, Mikolajczak & Hansenne, 2009).
Ability to control verbal and physical aggressiveness and
ability to control victimization were significantly more improved in the experimental group, similarly to the finding
of the study on the “Steps for Life” K-Programme effectiveness (Kourmousi, Salagianni, Merakou, Tzavara, &
Koutras, 2017; Kourmousi, 2012). These skills, widely met
in bullying prevention programmes appear to be targeted and achieved by other researchers as well (e.g. Powell
& Dunlap, 2009; Catalano et al., 2004; McMahon, Washburn, Felix, Yakin & Childrey, 2000; Aiken, West, Schwalm,
Carroll & Hsiung, 1998). This fact shows that school-based
programmess can tackle aggression and victimization effectively by social and emotional skills enhancement, as
indicated by WHO (2004b, p. 35). More specifically, cognitive and ecological approaches have been proven to
be significantly effective in bullying prevention skills (e.g.
Eron, L., Huesmann, R., Spindler, A., Guerra, N., Henry, D.,
& Tolan, P. (2002), since social-cognitive underpinnings of
aggression have been located (Huesmann, 1998) and the
impact of multiple contexts (e.g. teachers, peers, families)
has been clarified (Weissberg & Greenberg, 1997).
Empathy improved significantly higher in the elementary
students who attended the “Steps for Life” curriculum, as
had happened in the kindergarten ones, with the previous
unit of the programme (Kourmousi, Salagianni, Merakou,
Tzavara, & Koutras, 2017; Kourmousi, 2012). Empathy
seems to be a goal which several social skills interventions
seek to achieve, with quite many of them succeeding in
doing so (e.g. de Acedo Lizarraga, Ugarte, Cardelle-Elawar,
Iriarte, & de Acedo Baquedano, 2003; Committee for Children, 2002; Webster-Stratton & Hammond, 1997; Goldstein & Glick, 1994), proving that it is an ability that can be
ameliorated in students by cognitive interventions (e.g.
Gerdes, Segal, Jackson & Mullins, 2011) and by the use of
role-playing (Hojat, 2009; Feshbach, 1975).
Friendship skills were higher improved in the intervention
students. The “Steps for Life” Elementary Programme gives
emphasis on the specific skills’ teaching, by a) friendship
promoting activities like story-reading and club-founding,
b) the use of appropriate games such as the “secret friend”
or the “wheel of friendship”, and c) by the role-playing
steps for ways of joining a groups of friends. Friendship
skills and social competence skills in general are widely
sought by most similar interventions, which also appear to
achieve their goals (e.g. Griffin, Andrew, Caldarella, Sabey,
& Heath, 2017; Baker-Henningham, Scott, Jones & Walker,
2012; Bierman et al., 2010; Greenberg et al., 2003). Specifically, cognitive approaches (e.g. Mize & Ladd, 1990; Ladd
& Mize, 1983), systemic approaches (e.g. Bellini), and ones
that include role-playing (Rao, P. A., Beidel, D. C., & Murray,
M. J. 2008; Asher, Parker, & Walker, 1998) have been found
to enhance children’s friendship and social skills.
Problem-solving ability was significantly more improved in
the experimental group, as also observed in the effectiveness study of “Steps for Life” K-Programme (Kourmousi,
Salagianni, Merakou, Tzavara, & Koutras, 2017; Kourmousi, 2012). Not many mental health promotion and lifeskills programmes target problem solving ability, to our
knowledge. Our search of the relevant literature revealed
similar positive outcomes of the “I can Problem Solve”
programme evaluation (Shure & Spivack, 1982), confirming the fact that problem-solving can be taught to and
learned by students, through structured cognitive school
approaches (Shure & Spivack, 2008).
544
June 2018, Volume 10, Issue 5, 535-549
Ability to take responsibility, was higher improved in the
presented study’s intervention students. Though no specific lesson of the investigated programme was dedicated
to this ability, addressing the issue of truth and lying and a
lesson about dealing with guilt might have contributed to
this improvement. Moreover, the humanistic approach’s
unconditional acceptance of the students by their teachers, combined with the lack of criticism could also be
factors which led to this change. The literature search on
similar studies did not reveal similar results; ability to take
responsibility does not seem to consist a goal for most
social-emotional skills’ programmes, despite Elias’ and
Schwab’s, work (2006) which depicts responsibility as a significant social-emotional learning skill, and despite Dede’s
work (2010) which characterizes it as an important 21st
century skill. Curiously, there are impressively more studies teaching responsibility taking through physical education activities (e.g. Quay & Peters, 2008; Wright & Burton,
2008; Hellison, 2003).
Finally, the use of spoken and written language improved
significantly higher in the students who attended the
“Steps for Life” programme. This finding is compatible
with the ones of other similar studies which have shown
that the enhancement of social and emotional skills in students results in ameliorating their academic performance
as well (Babalis, Tsoli, Artikis, Mylonakou-Keke, & Xanthakou, 2013; Ashdown & Bernard, 2012; Brackett et al., 2012;
Durlak et al., 2011; Diekstra & Gravesteijn, 2008; Payton et
al., 2008; Zins, 2004; NRCIM, 2000).
Overall, our evaluation revealed a positive effect of the
“Steps for Life” programme in the enhancement of personal and social skills in elementary students.
Implications of The Study
The study builds on the existing literature regarding the
effectiveness of similar interventions, by corroborating
the findings of other researchers and also by investigating
the specific intervention’s impact on skills which have not
been quite investigated (e.g. concentration of attention,
responsibility taking).
Concerning Greece, the study will even help in the consolidation of the understanding of the importance of conducting evaluation research, in order for the educators to
have evidence-based approaches to use in their teaching.
Moreover, it will help spread the perception that emotional skills can be taught by teachers who have not attended
related courses during their undergraduate studies, with
the guidance of evidence-based training and structured
curricula.
Limitations and Strengths of The Study
The study has several strengths, with its large sample-size
being a very important one. Also, the representation of
urban, rural and industrial areas, as well as high, middle
and low-income ones – according to the Hellenic Statistical
Authority (2011) –, ensured the fact that all types of areas
and all types of income were included. Furthermore, the
fact that the study was conducted in Attica, the prefecture
in which Greece’s capital is located and in which 35,5% of
the Greek population resides (Hellenic Statistical Authority, 2012), added further to the representativeness of the
sample.
Apart from the large sample size and its representativeness, another strong point of the study was the monitoring
and continuous evaluation of its implementation fidelity.
However, the study also had some weak points. The use
of teachers as facilitators of the intervention programme
and evaluators of the students’ behaviors consists one,
even though it is a tactic often used in universal school
programmes’ evaluations and adopted by several researchers, mostly due to the lack of financing (Ashdown
& Bernard, 2012; Brackett et al., 2012; Durlak et al., 2011;
Diekstra & Gravesteijn, 2008; Domitrovich, Cortes &
Greenberg, 2007; Mishara & Ystgaard, 2006; Vazsonyi, Belliston & Flannery, 2004).
Another weak point of the presented research is the lack
of a follow-up study, which would investigate the sustainability of its results.
Conclusions
Our ‘”Steps for Life’ Life” intervention verified our hypotheses, since all the targeted, taught and investigated personal and social skills, were significantly more improved
in the experimental group of elementary students than
the controls. The results confirm the findings of other
researchers who concluded that universal mental health
promotion school-based programmes which are structured and systemic, have a cognitive approach and a long
duration, disseminate the knowledge of the taught skills in
the formal and hidden curriculum, and also transfer it in
the students’ lives by involving their parents, can enhance
socio-emotional skills and help prevent problem behaviors as well (Bear, Whitcomb, Elias, Blank, 2015; Durlak et
al., 2011; Diekstra & Gravesteijn, 2008; Payton et al., 2008;
Wilson, Gottfredson & Najaka, 2001; Durlak & Wells, 1997).
Concerning Greece, we hope to contribute in making
teachers feel secure in teaching a subject for which they
have not received any training during their under-graduate studies. We also hope that this type of education will
soon be more generalized in both primary and secondary education, so that all students can profit from it and
acquire the skills that will help them deal effectively with
every-day difficulties, achieve better academic performance, and gain social and emotional well-being.
