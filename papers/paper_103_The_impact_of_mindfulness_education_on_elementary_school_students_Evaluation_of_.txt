Introduction
The students are the real wealth of the nation
and society must be prepared for life, including the
development of writing and reading skills, the maximum
extension of the hand of reform is the book must be a
systematic evaluation of the curriculum to learn the
extent to which the goals set for them 1 Reading is very
important in the elementary stage as a natural entry point
for learning and primary school fails miserably if it fails
to teach its students to read because the student’s success
and progress in all subjects depend on his literacy
ability is not material with content that can be taught
separately from other subjects But is a fundamental part
of every other material. It has become clear that there
is a need for something new if schools are to start from
a traditional mindset that is focused on capacity only
so that students can have a kind of mind-set to create a
productive self-fulfilling life and therefore the need for
effective and effective mental habits such as the need
to develop educational goals that reflect The belief that
ability is a repertoire of skills that the individual stores
and continues to be constantly expanding as one can
increase the skill of thinking through man’s efforts.
Education in its general form is a familiar process for all
reflect an activity produced by human societies across
many times and places, It is not only a reflection of
social, economic and political life, but it is an important
tool in the development and formation of this life,
including from different social systems the prosperity of
nations and the attainment of their goals are linked to
their concerns. These nations raise and nurture a strong
generation to take responsibility for the leadership of
the nations and hand them over from fathers to sons,
therefore, attention to education means providing the
right direction and congratulating the environment for
the emergence of righteous individuals. Language has a
great role in the twenty-first century because it is a new
world in which information prevails in all spheres of life
as the individual is able to get the information he needs
as quickly as possible in the least effort and language is
the basic goal through which he knows what he wants 1
 .
One of these languages is the Arabic language that every
speaker has the right to be proud of and is magnified
by our Arabic language, which is characterized by the
beauty of its methods and the strength of its expression
and its vast wealth of words and meanings. reading is
the means of the numbers of the individual scientifically
and morally is a means of personal harmony and social
assistance to the individual to autonomy and adaptation
with others and reading helps to quickly understand and
gain desired attitudes and behaviors. The textbook offers
opportunities for the teacher to use many of the teaching
methods, especially those that need to have a textbook
in the hands of the student when the teacher assigned
a student or several students to read a paragraph of

the book to develop information or a comparison with
external information is the basic premise in front of
students to the world of research, knowledge, thinking
and knowledge.
Methodology
The researcher followed descriptive research
methodology to analyze the book of Arabic reading
for the fourth grade of primary school because it
means describing the facts to identify the data related
to a particular educational phenomenon and follow
closely and analyze and interpret and investigate the
relationships and connotations and then access to the
explanatory and complementary instructions can be used
16 The researcher relied on the analytical descriptive
approach because it is a method that is compatible with
the nature of the research and its requirements. The
descriptive approach is a method for studying scientific
phenomena or problems through scientific description
and then reaching logical explanations with signs and
bar Yen and that research is descriptive of a wider use
of research in educational and psychological field it is
usually looking at the present and diagnose existing
phenomena and the relationships with the discovery by
classifying them and their works on the interpretation of
those phenomena 9
Identify the research community and its sample :
The research community is identified and identified
by the researcher to define their research community as
well as to define their own identity so that the current
research community is determined the fourth grade

The Research Tool:
As regards to lack of a ready and appropriate tool to
gather information commensurate with the purposes and
objectives of the research, the researcher adopted the
questionnaire as a tool for research and to prepare this
tool, the researcher followed the following steps:
- List habits of reason:
In order to reach the list of habits of mind and use
that list in the analysis of the book of reading for the
fourth grade of primary The researcher adopted the
following steps:
1 - Review previous studies on the habits of reason
2 - Access to literature and books that dealt with the
habits of mind
3 - The preparation of the preliminary list of the
habits of reason based on the researcher’s knowledge of
past efforts
4 - Directing an open survey questionnaire for
supervisors and teachers of the Arabic language in
684 Indian Journal of Forensic Medicine & Toxicology, April-June 2020, Vol. 14, No. 2
primary schools, including the following questions:
- What habits should be read in the fourth grade
reading books? Please specify in terms of relevance to
the primary stage
- Do you think that the book of Arabic reading meets
the habits of mind appropriate for the primary stage?
5. Distribution of the preliminary list of the habits of
the mind to a group of specialists in the Arabic language
to analyze them and determine whether the principles
and their sub-indicators belong to the domains received
and have been compiled and studied and used to reach
the final list .
The tool’s credibility:
Honesty is one of the important characteristics
of educational tests and standards psychological and
different and is one of the old concepts so it is subjected
to a lot of modification and change as a result of the
spread and the expansion of the movement of tests and
standards in the various humanities 12 and the truth of
several types of the researcher has used what fits the
nature of her research which is the apparent truthfulness
of the initial examination of the content of the instrument
and is reached by the consensus of the arbitrators’
assessment of the measure of the instrument to which
it was prepared 14 and to achieve the credibility of the
tool based on the credibility of arbitrators and specialists
in Arabic language and literature and curricula and
methods of teaching as well as those who teach Arabic
reading for the fourth grade of primary school .The
researcher presented the tool in its initial form in order to
ascertain the apparent honesty. The arbitrators expressed
their observations about the tool and took the researcher
. The researcher has adopted (80%) of the opinion of
the arbitrators on the validity of the paragraphs , this is
indicated by Bloom, as 80% and more of the arbitrators
are evidence of an investigation virtual honesty 2
The Analysis:
A – The analysis unit : The researcher used the unit
of thought in its analysis of the book of Arabic reading,
if it is one of the most important units of analysis and
the largest and may be the unity of the idea or phrase
contains the idea that revolves around the subject of
analysis 15
B- The analysis steps:
1- Reading each topic of the Arabic reading book
for the fourth grade of the primary to identify the ideas
contained in the subject in general
2 - Second reading of each line in the subject for the
purpose of reaching the phrase or sentence that contains
a particular idea
3 - The identification of the phrase containing a
specific idea added by the researcher to the principles
prepared in advance and work to determine the suitability
of this idea with each paragraph of this principle in a
special analysis form
4 - Give a repeat of each paragraph correspond to
the idea extracted
5 - Calculate the frequencies obtained by each
paragraph in one principle and then calculate the
frequencies of each principle individually .
The stability analysis:
While the method of content analysis is a scientific
tool, there is a need to satisfy the conditions of objectivity,
and achieving objectivity requires knowledge of the
stability of the analysis. In terms of consistency, the
results obtained from applying the analysis tool to the
same sample are not changed 20 and one of the most
prominent methods of verification of the stability of the
most common analysis of the presentation of a sample of
the analyzed article on a group of experts and specialists
and the people of know-how and experience in the
analysis of content 19
So the researcher used two experts who have
knowledge in the analysis of the content given each of
them a random sample and 10% of the analyzed material
from the topics of the book of reading and the researcher
calculated the correlation between them and the two
experts was the correlation coefficient between them and
the first analyst (92,0) And between them and the other
analyst (85,0%)
The statistical means:
The researcher used the program (spss) statistical
means to analyze the results as follows:
1 - The weighted average to measure the extent to
which each concept of the questionnaire
2-Square Kai to calculate the honesty of building
concepts
Indian Journal of Forensic Medicine & Toxicology, April-June 2020, Vol. 14, No. 2 685
3 - Holistic coefficient to calculate the stability of
concepts
4-Percent weight to be used in interpreting the
results .
Results
The researcher reached the following results: Taking
into account the book of Arabic reading of some habits
of the mind, which means taking into account individual
differences between students. The habits of the mind
give a wide range in the educational process to help the
teacher to understand the minds of students and enhance
their role in providing opportunities for students to learn
and think in different ways. The planning and preparation
of lessons through the habits of the mind left a great
impact on the students, which led to an understanding of
the students to read and assimilate well.
Conclusion
The researcher has developed three alternatives
(valid), (invalid), (need to be modified), and the
researcher used the appropriate statistical means for their
research. The data obtained from the analysis process
are: Holistic equation, centimeter weight, square cay,
and weighted mean
