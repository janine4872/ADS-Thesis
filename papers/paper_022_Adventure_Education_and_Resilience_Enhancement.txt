Abstract
Introduction
This study examines the impact of Outdoor Adventure Education (OAE) on developing grit and resilience in adolescents. Focusing on a United States-based sample collected in 2015, it explores how antecedent variables such as age and gender influence these outcomes, integrating the PERMA model of well-being to investigate underlying mechanisms.
Methods
The research employed a cross-sectional design with 350 participants aged 14–18 from various OAE courses. Data collection involved pre/post surveys assessing grit and resilience as experiences through mastery, relatedness, and emotional reactivity. The study utilized established inventories for grit and the Resilience Scales for Children and Adolescents.
Results
Findings revealed significant grit, mastery, and relatedness increases following the OAE program. Participants demonstrated enhanced perseverance and passion toward goals, increased sense of mastery, and better relational dynamics. However, emotional reactivity scores remained largely unchanged. Notably, the impact of these programs varied based on participants' gender and socioeconomic status, indicating differential effects across demographic groups.
Conclusions
The study suggests that OAE programs effectively foster grit and resilience in adolescents, with varying impacts based on demographic factors. It highlights the necessity for inclusive and adaptive program designs that cater to diverse participant needs. The results contribute valuable insights to the field of youth development, emphasizing the role of OAE in enhancing key psychological traits essential for adolescents' growth and adaptation.
1 INTRODUCTION
Outdoor adventure education (OAE) programs are becoming increasingly popular to promote positive youth development (Ardoin et al., 2022; Waid & Uhrich, 2019). These programs help young people learn and grow by engaging in outdoor activities and challenges in nature (Ewert & Sibthorp, 2014). Researchers are now investigating the impact of OAE on important traits and outcomes (Ewert & Davidson, 2021; Leonard et al., 2022). This project seeks to add to this narrative by focusing on two such variables: grit, which refers to perseverance and passion toward long-term goals (Duckworth et al., 2007), and resilience, which is the ability to cope effectively with adversity (Masten, 2001). Studies have shown that OAE programs can increase grit and resilience in youth populations (Davidson, 2016; Leonard et al., 2022). However, our understanding of how OAE influences these traits and the pre-existing demographics of those attending OAE programs is still limited.
The study examines how antecedent variables affect adolescents' grit, resilience as a result of participation in an OAE program. The analysis considers the factors that predict changes in these outcome variables, such as age and gender. This research applies the multidimensional PERMA model of well-being (Seligman, 2018) to elucidate mechanisms underlying outcomes. PERMA encompasses positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment. Though studied in education contexts (Kern et al., 2015), PERMA has seen limited application to OAE. Findings from this study will provide insight into how PERMA contributes to grit and resilience changes, expanding theoretical knowledge of how OAE impacts youth development. Further, this study will elucidate how sociodemographic factors contribute to changes in grit and resilience.
1.1 Literature review
The pursuit of understanding grit and resilience has found substantial grounding in both individual research realms, with each construct thoroughly explored through various theories and empirical assessments. By interweaving these domains, this study utilizes data collected from participants at a major OAE program seeking to discern the impact of involvement in these types of experiences on the levels of grit and resilience and what role subject variables play in predicting outcome attainment. The ensuing literature review navigates the pivotal and contemporaneous works related to these constructs, outlining prevailing themes, empirical revelations, and advancements in theory, all within the contextual frame of the PERMA model and OAE programming.
1.2 Outdoor adventure education & PERMA
OAE refers to experiential learning programs that utilize adventure activities in remote outdoor environments, such as backpacking, rock climbing, or kayaking (Ewert & Sibthorp, 2014). OAE programs aim to provide participants with technical skills, leadership development, and opportunities for personal growth, typically on a course lasting five to 90 days with an average length of experience of around 14 days. In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding how participation in OAE may benefit factors related to student success and achievement motivation in addition to other pro-social psychological factors (Blaine & Akhurst, 2020; Mateer et al., 2023).
For example, Overholt and Ewert (2015) examined an OAE program's impact on university students' resilience. Resilience was defined as experiencing growth after a disruptive event. Students completed a questionnaire assessing their resilience levels before and after participating in the adventure program, leisure, or leadership classes. Results showed an interesting interaction effect between gender and time—males reported decreased resilience after the program, while females showed increased resilience. Follow-up interviews suggested this difference may be attributed to variance in self-perception, expectations, and self-assessment between genders entering the program.
Richmond et al. (2018) specifically examined how OAE experiences can develop “noncognitive” skills like grit, self-efficacy, and social skills in adolescents. Students participated in multi-day OAE courses and were later interviewed. OAE increased social connectedness, leadership self-efficacy, and recalibrated sense of self among students. The shared school environment allowed these benefits to be reinforced instead of lost once the program ended, as may be the case with other, shorter-term OAE courses. This study provides evidence that OAE can positively impact academic motivation and perseverance factors, both of which relate to the construct of grit.
Finally, Scrutton and Beames (2015) conducted research in Scotland to provide quantitative evidence that OAE improves personal and social development in children. Students aged 10–12 completed questionnaires before and after a residential OAE experience. A small positive impact was found after the program, but it diminished in 10 weeks, likely because the experience was not integrated into regular schoolwork. Interestingly, students with poorer initial personal and social skills benefited the most from the program. This work is important to the development of this study, given that few other works have tried to highlight predictive factors for successful intervention on these selected variables.
As suggested, the burgeoning body of literature suggests that OAE programs can positively impact noncognitive factors like resilience, grit, self-efficacy, and social skills, which are tied to motivation and achievement. However, gender, initial skill levels, and post-program reinforcement may mediate outcomes. The PERMA model integrates both hedonic and eudaimonic aspects of well-being, making it a valuable framework for assessing psychological health across various contexts and also helps provide a framework for conceptualizing how OAE programming might contribute to youth development.
In the context of OAE, the components of PERMA could represent potential pathways to enhance attributes like grit and resilience. For instance, activities that promote meaning and elicit positive emotions are likely to build resilience, as evidenced in studies by Morgan and Simmons (2021) and similarly by Gloria and Steinhardt (2016). Similarly, the sense of accomplishment from overcoming challenges in OAE could foster perseverance, aligning with the findings of Farmer and Cotter (2021).
The current study aims to fill this gap by implementing and evaluating a PERMA-based OAE program, focusing on its effects on grit, resilience, and the five elements of PERMA. This approach is expected to provide deeper insight into how outdoor adventures may contribute to developing these traits and overall well-being, drawing on the work of Smith et al. (2021) and Ho et al. (2020) in similar contexts. The findings from this study will contribute to our understanding of the PERMA model's effectiveness within OAE and inform efforts to optimize such programs for the comprehensive development of youth.
1.2.1 Grit
In recent years, the concept of grit has gained significant attention among educational researchers and practitioners. Grit refers to having perseverance and passion for long-term goals (Duckworth et al., 2007). In simple terms, grit involves sustaining effort and maintaining determination despite adversity, plateaus, and failure over the course of years or decades. The popularity of grit stems from research showing its association with achievement across domains, including educational attainment, grade point average (GPA), retention in demanding academic programs, and other positive outcomes (Fernández-Martín et al., 2020). Proponents argue grit has potential as an actionable target for interventions aimed at improving student success. However, conceptualization and measurement issues remain, and critics have raised concerns about overemphasizing grit, potentially shifting responsibility away from needed systemic reforms (Credé et al., 2017; Golden, 2017).
Grit was conceptualized as entailing two related but distinct facets: (1) perseverance of effort (working strenuously toward challenges), and (2) consistency of interests (pursuing the same goals and interests over time). Though shorter versions have also been used, Duckworth and Quinn (2009) developed and validated a 12-item Grit Scale with six items tapping each facet. Research found grit was only weakly correlated with IQ but was associated with Big Five conscientiousness, suggesting grit represents a noncognitive attribute distinct from intellectual ability.
Initial studies by Duckworth and colleagues focused on grit predicting success and retention in demanding domains like military training, competitive spelling bees, Ivy League undergraduate programs, and others (Duckworth et al., 2007; Eskreis-Winkler et al., 2014). For example, West Point cadets higher in baseline grit were more likely to complete the rigorous summer training program ('Beast Barracks') and ultimately graduate (Kelly et al., 2014). Grit also emerged as a stronger predictor than IQ or conscientiousness for reaching the final round in the Scripps National Spelling Bee, accounting for differences in accumulated deliberate practice (Duckworth et al., 2011).
Within education, grit has been linked to various positive outcomes, including high school GPA, college GPA, graduation, and intent to persist among diverse samples (Bowman et al., 2015; Strayhorn, 2014) A meta-analysis by Credé et al. (2017) estimated a significant though modest correlation between overall grit scores and academic performance. However, they found that the perseverance facet exhibited substantially stronger links with academic outcomes than consistency of interests. The meta-analysis also showed grit had minimal predictive validity for performance after controlling for conscientiousness.
While correlations do not imply causation, results have sparked interest in interventions to enhance grit. Duckworth et al. (2013) demonstrated that the Mental Contrasting with Implementation Intentions (MCII) strategy significantly improves academic performance in economically disadvantaged fifth graders, compared to traditional positive thinking approaches. Yet few studies have evaluated programs aiming to build grit over months or years. Some charter school networks, such as the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP), have adopted explicit character education focused on grit and self-control. KIPP schools employ core tactics like conspicuously posting character strengths, formally assessing character, and integrating grit concepts into the curriculum (Tough, 2012). Critics argue such intensive behavioral conditioning risks damaging student creativity and emotional well-being (Strauss, 2016). Despite burgeoning interest in grit, conceptual ambiguities persist, including the validity of combining passion and perseverance facets into a single grit construct. The near equivalence of perseverance and Big Five conscientiousness also raises concerns grit is simply conscientiousness rebranded (Credé, 2018; Rimfeld et al., 2016).
More broadly, critics argue grit rhetoric problematically shifts responsibility for inequality onto students and teachers while ignoring social, cultural, and economic structures limiting opportunity (Anderson et al., 2016; Kannangara et al., 2018) Emphasis on noncognitive skills could allow policymakers to minimize material deprivation or discrimination facing marginalized youth. Duckworth has cautioned against grit becoming a panacea or displacing other needed reforms (Duckworth, 2016).
1.2.2 Resilience
The role of OAE in fostering resilience and mental well-being among various populations has been a growing focus in recent literature. Davidson and Ewert's (2024) study on the mental health outcomes of OAE programs, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlights the potential of these programs in enhancing resilience and coping with anxiety and hopelessness. Similarly, Brown et al. (2023) emphasize the efficacy of outdoor programs integrated with mountain biking in enhancing middle school students' resiliency, particularly focusing on the “Sense of Mastery” aspect. These studies collectively underscore the significance of OAE in promoting mental well-being, suggesting their vital role in contemporary educational and therapeutic settings (Brown et al., 2023; Davidson & Ewert, 2024).
Research has also explored the specific impacts of OAE on different demographic groups, revealing a nuanced understanding of how these programs benefit various participants. Talley, Bobilya, and Stonehouse (2023) provide insights into the transformative experiences of adolescent girls in long-term OAE programs, emphasizing the development of leadership skills, resilience, and enjoyment of nature. This focus on gender-specific experiences is further echoed in Tilstra et al., (2022) investigation of gender and risk in OAE, revealing inherent gender biases and stereotypes in risk management and program design. These studies highlight the need for more inclusive and gender-sensitive approaches in OAE to accommodate and leverage the diverse experiences of participants.
The organizational aspect of OAE, particularly in response to external crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, has been another focal point. Rabinowitz et al., (2022) delve into the resilience of OAE organizations during the pandemic, noting the challenges and subsequent adaptations these organizations underwent. Their findings on organizational resilience and effectiveness in crisis management provide a valuable perspective on the need for adaptability and robust planning in OAE programs. This organizational focus is crucial for understanding how OAE can sustain and evolve in the face of global challenges and societal shifts.
Finally, the application of OAE in higher education settings, specifically its impact on new university students' resilience, offers a unique angle to this body of literature. A recent study found that OA residential programs significantly enhance resilience in university inductees, outperforming traditional university-based induction programs (Allan & McKenna, 2019). This gap in the literature regarding the specific role of OAE in youth development contexts is addressed by their work, suggesting that OAE programs can be integral in aiding the transition and adaptation of students to university life. The study thus contributes to the broader discourse on the benefits of OAE in educational settings, highlighting its potential to foster resilience among higher education students.
In sum, the current project aims to contribute to these discussions by exploring the specific impacts of OAE programs on diverse populations, with a particular focus on mental health outcomes like grit and resilience. This project seeks to contribute to this literature by first exploring the impact of OAE programming on resilience. Additionally, this work seeks to illuminate how antecedent variables may impact outcome attainment in OAE participation.
1.2.3 Grit, resilience, and outdoor adventure education
Though distinct, grit and resilience share conceptual overlap. Both constructs emphasize perseverance through challenges and retaining goal-directed effort despite setbacks. Grit may also buffer against the negative effects of stress and build resilience (Datu, 2021). OAE programs may offer a fertile context for developing grit, resilience, and other mental wellness-related variables. Further, what type of OAE participant might most benefit from participation is an important question and the focus of this study.
OAE experiences intentionally expose participants to difficult skill development, physical exertion, uncertainty, and perceived risk (Ewert & Garvey, 2007). These challenges present opportunities to model, build, and reinforce gritty behavior. Reflective processing is used to generalize learning to life outside the course (Baldwin, 2016). For example, Goldenberg et al. (2005) propose the experiential learning cycle of briefing, experience, debriefing, and transfer can instill outcomes like grit and resilience as participants plan goals, attempt challenging tasks, evaluate efforts, and discuss applications and learnings from their OAE experience.
Furthermore, OAE provides strengths-based programming and access to protective factors like caring instructors, supportive peer groups, skill development, and experiences of overcoming obstacles. Research indicates OAE fosters resilience in youth and young adult populations (Kelly, 2019; Soria et al., 2022). Neill and Dias (2001) suggest resilience is enhanced through controlled exposure to risk and adaptive stress in outdoor programs.
In summary, promoting grit and resilience represents viable goals for OAE aligned with its experiential methods. Fostering perseverance and positive adaptation can equip participants to overcome challenges and thrive during and beyond their courses. This study seeks to contribute to the body of literature surrounding the benefits of OAE programming and explore what antecedent variables may mediate changes in selected variables.
1.3 Methods
The study included teenagers aged 14–18 enrolled in selected OAE courses. To participate in the project, the students had to enroll in at least one OAE course of a minimum duration of 5 days, which involved activities like rock climbing and backpacking. All participants were required to provide informed consent via mailed forms and standard informational packets from the host organization. Additionally, minor participants were asked for assent at the beginning of the course. Those who did not provide consent were excluded from participation. The study aimed to have a sample of 350 participants, based on anticipated enrollment figures and previous records from the host institution to ensure sufficient statistical power for subsequent analyses.
Before initiating the study, approval was secured from the host's Institutional Review Board. The research employed a pre/post survey design, with data collection points at the commencement and conclusion of the courses (two separate data collection times). This method, substantiated by existing literature, effectively discerns behavioral shifts post-intervention (Cobb et al., 2003). Surveys were administered by the instructional staff, who also facilitated the student's OAE course.
Grit was assessed using an established inventory comprising two dimensions: interest and effort (Duckworth & Quinn, 2009). Grit. Eight items were used to assess grit—participants were asked to respond to items about how they felt before and after the course on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Items included “I finish whatever I begin” and “New ideas and projects sometimes distract me” (reverse-scored). The scale showed acceptable reliability for both pre- and post-course assessments (Grit Pre α = 0.72; Grit Post α = 0.68).
The Resilience Scales for Children and Adolescents (RSCA) was administered as a pre- and a posttest before and after the OAE course (Prince-Embury, 2008). This instrument is comprised of three subscales: sense of mastery (20 items), sense of relatedness (24 items), and emotional reactivity (20 items) (p. 172). Item responses are in Likert-scale format from 0 (never) to 5 (almost always).
1.3.1 Mastery
Twenty items were used to assess MST—participants were asked to respond to items about how they felt before and after the course on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Items included “I am good at fixing things” and “I can let others help me when I need to”. The scale showed acceptable reliability for both pre- and post-course assessments (MST Pre α = 0.86; MST Post α = 0.91).
1.3.2 Relatedness
Twenty-four items were used to assess RLTD—participants were asked to respond to items about how they felt before and after the course on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Items included “I can calmly tell others that I don't agree with them.” and “can depend on those closest to me to do the right thing”. The scale showed acceptable reliability for both pre- and post-course assessments (RLTD Pre α = 0.92; RLTD Post α = 0.93).
1.3.3 Emotional reactivity
Twenty items were used to assess EMO—participants were asked to respond to items about how they felt before and after the course on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Items included “I get very upset when things don't go my way.” and “When I get upset, I do things that I later feel bad about.” The scale showed acceptable reliability for both pre- and post-course assessments (MST Pre α = 0.86; MST Post α = 0.91).
1.3.4 Sociodemographics
A few primary predictors of changes in course-related outcomes included gender (0 = female, 1 = male), age (grouped as 1 = 12 to 15, 2 = 16-18, 3 = 19-30, 4 = 31 +), ethnicity (0 =  ethnic minority, 1 = White), and socioeconomic status (operationalized by receiving a scholarship; 0 = no, 1 = yes).
2 ANALYTIC STRATEGY
A Bayesian approach with latent variables in MPlus version 8.8 (Muthén & Muthén, 2017) was used in this study to assess changes in our outcomes of interest over the span of the course. This approach was used as Bayesian methods do not require distributional assumptions of normality, which would account for potential nonnormality in the distribution of our variables of interest and allow for a more accurate estimate of effects (Yuan & MacKinnon, 2009). The process of assessing our outcomes would, therefore, begin with an assessment of model fit via the measurement model for our 4 pre-intervention and 4-post intervention variables, estimated using a latent variable approach. Then, a method of assessing approximate measurement invariance (AMI) between our pre- and post-course scores will be employed—this approach intends to show that the latent factors for each of our outcomes of interest can be reliably compared to their pre-assessment counterparts. Using the step-by-step approach found in Asparouhov et al. (2015), AMI is assessed by testing which variance value is affiliated with negligible changes in overall fit when compared to the prior variance value. Values often start very low (e.g., υ = 0.001) and slowly increase until the deviance value (DIC) and posterior-predictive p-value (PPP) values do not change in a significant manner. However, as noted in Cain and Zhang (2018), “in larger samples PPP will always reject a model even with minimal misspecification,” suggesting that the p-value in this case is, perhaps, not as informative as our DIC value, which Cain and Zhang (2018) also notes is better at detecting the correct model as samples size increase. Therefore, considering our sample size of well over 500, we have elected to place stronger emphasis on DIC changes between variance levels as a primary indicator of changes in fit.
After assessing AMI, a Bayesian latent growth model will be used to assess changes in the four outcomes of interest, modeling the slope effect between the two time points to assess if there are changes in the scores over the course. Finally, our covariates (age, SES, ethnicity, and participant gender) will be entered as predictors of the slope variable, to assess if different demographic groups had different degrees of change in the four outcomes. A diagram of the schematic overview of the Bayesian Latent Growth Model approach (in this case characterized as a 'Latent Change Model') can be found in Figure 1.

3 RESULTS
Bivariate correlations and descriptive statistics can be found in Table 1. Notably, both pre- and post-course grit scores were related to higher MST scores (rs > 0.28, ps < 0.001), pre- and post-course MST scores were related to higher RLTD scores (rs > 0.54, ps < 0.001), and pre- and post-course grit scores were related to higher RLTD scores as well (rs > 0.25, ps < 0.001). All MST, RLTD, and grit scores were related to lower were related to lower EMO scores (| r | s >  0.13, ps < 0.005). As for predictors, pre-course grit scores were related to having received a scholarship (r = 0.15, p = 0.001) and lower age (r = −0.14, p = 0.002). A similar pattern emerged for MST scores and RLTD scores—higher MST was related to having received a scholarship (r = 0.22, p < 0.001) and lower age (r = −0.19, p < 0.001), and higher RLTD was related to having received a scholarship (r = 0.14, p = 0.003) and lower age (r = −0.18, p < 0.001). Gender was only weakly related to lower post-course MST (r = −0.10, p − 0.039) and RLTD scores (r = −0.10, p = 0.046).

3.1 General model fit
Measurement models were estimated in MPlus for each of the four pairs of variables (e.g., Pre Grit-Post Grit) to assess a general level of model fit. Each of the four models displayed adequate fit (statistics found below in Table 2).

3.2 Approximate measurement invariance
Next, we sought to use a latent variable approach to assess changes in our four outcomes variable over the course. However, we first needed to assess that the latent variables created for our four outcomes were approximately invariant. Therefore, we modelled the pre- and post-course scores for Grit, MST, RLTD, and EMO scales with each of their scale items as indicators and used zero-mean, small-variance priors for the intercepts across time for each of the pairs of latent variables. Variance was slowly increased until only negligible changes in DIC were detected. As shown in Table 3, most of the variables stabilized in their DIC values between υ = 0.010 and υ = 0.050—small-variance priors of υ = 0.100 did not display a meaningful change in model fit when compared to the υ = 0.010 values (or υ = 0.050 in the case of grit). Furthermore, the υ = 0.100 runs required much longer convergence time, further suggesting that υ = 0.010 is generally sufficient to consider minor deviations from exact intercept equivalence, and we can assume that approximate scalar MI holds in this case. Approximate measurement invariance allows us to make more confident conclusions based on the interpretation of the latent means for the pre- and post-course assessment scores.

υ = 0.100 19302.17 38157.24 46735.13 41110.86
Note: Bolded DIC values show where DIC estimates stabilized.
A latent growth approach was next used to assess changes in the latent factors for each of the four outcomes over the two time points. This approach models the intercept and slope of the pre and post course assessment, with the slope indicating the increase in the outcome over one unit increase in time. In this case, with only two time points, the post-course assessment was set as the second time point, so a significant slope would indicate a difference in pre- and post-course course scores.1
3.3 Model specification
The Bayesian change models were estimated using priors on intercepts, factor loadings, and slopes with 3 chain sequences set in MPlus. Although little work has been done specifically targeting resilience, a prior study looking to boost resilience using outdoor physical activity programs in Malaysia was used as a potential source for more strongly informed priors of the standardized mean differences between pre- and post-intervention scores. In their study, Samsudin et al. (2021) found a small effect size based on the mean scores reported, so an informative prior was used for the slope's distribution to be centered around 0.15 with a 0.10 variance to represent a small effect size. As for variances, little information can be found in the literature on intercept values for such studies, so a generic weakly informative priors for variance used normally-distributed, zero-mean, small-variance informative priors for the intercepts (variance of 1). As for regression coefficients, once again, little prior work has been conducted on predictors of OAE resilience program success, although work from Allan et al. (2024) recently found small-to-moderate effects sizes for gender differences in OAE program outcomes—the Cohen's d effects were ~.46 in this study. Potential significant effects were presumed to be similar effect sizes, although there was less confidence in these effects as with the slope, which had a somewhat analogous correlate in prior work. Therefore, regression coefficient distributions were centered around 0.30 with a 1.0 variance.
Convergence parameters will be reported using the iterations output found in the TECH8 section of MPlus, which reports the potential scale reduction value (PSR). This value is expected to be closer to 1, wich indicates a lower likelihood that the weighted average of between-chain and within-chain variances has not converged, although the value being less than 1.10 is a cutoff generally used in the literature (Gelman et al., 2004). An unconditional model was employed by fixing the first factor loading at 0 and the second factor loading at 1. The slope, in this case, would represent the change from the pre-intervention measurement to the post-intervention measurement. Autocorrelation plots were observed in MPlus to search for the potential that autocorrelation diminished the effective sample—each estimate in MCMC is correlated with previous estimates, but plots should indicate that autocorrelation values hover around a somewhat consistent mean score after an initial spike.
Model estimation was carried out effectively, with each of the four outcomes producing PSR values under 1.10. Furthermore, autocorrelation plots suggested that issues with autocorrelation were minimal (example autocorrelation plots pulled from MPlus into R can be found in the Supplemental File). Convergence statistics and slope values can be found in Table 4 below.

EMO 1.04 0.01 0.002 <0.001
The slope for MST was significant (β = 0.07, [0.01, 0.99], p = 0.002) as was the slope for the EMO outcome (β = 0.69, [0.02, 2.06], p < 0.001). The slope for Grit was significant via the directional p-value (β = 0.37, [−0.05, 1.68], p = 0.044). The slope for RLTD was not statistically significant (β = 0.001, [−0.055, 0.067], p = 0.469). A full list of parameter estimates can be found in the Supplemental File.
Finally, effects were estimated in MPlus for age, SES, ethnicity, and participant gender predicting the slope for each of the four outcomes—significant effects would suggest that the variable significantly predicts the extent to which the course elicited changes in the outcome variable of interest. For the grit outcome, SES was not significantly linked with the slope of change (βSES = −0.04 [−0.40, 0.28], p = 0.411)—women, white participants, and older participants tended to have higher increases in grit scores, although these effects only approached significance (βGENDER = −0.15 [−0.62, 0.26], p = 0.201; βETNC = 0.20, [−0.12, 0.72], p = 0.112; βAGE = 0.16, [−0.21, 0.66], p = 0.183). For the MST outcome, older participants, higher SES participants, and white partiicpants tended to have higher rates of change (βAGE = 0.54 [0.22, 0.89], p < 0.001; βSES = 0.27, [−0.03, 0.62], p = 0.036; βETNC = 0.33, [0.05, 0.70], p = 0.011)—women tended to have greater increases in MST scores, although this effect only approached significance (βGENDER = −0.23 [−0.60, 0.09], p = 0.072). For RLTD scores, gender and SES did not predict changes in scores (βGENDER = −0.05 [−0.39, 0.25], p = 0.364; βSES = 0.17, [−0.10, 0.47], p = 0.104)—older participants and white participants tended to have significantly higher change in RLTD (βAGE = 0.56, [0.29, 0.83], p < 0.001; βETNC = 0.52, [0.22, 0.79], p < 0.001). Older participants tended to show greater change in EMO scores (βAGE = 0.15, [−0.02, 0.35], p = 0.046)— participants from higher SES backgrounds, women, and white participants tended to show greater change in EMO scores, though thse effects were not statstically significant (βSES = 0.09 [−0.09, 0.31], p = 0.156; βGENDER = −0.07 [−0.30, 0.14], p = 0.265; βETNC = 0.08, [−0.11, 0.32], p = 0.205).
4 DISCUSSION
The data from this study offers compelling insights into the impact of specific course interventions on youth development, particularly concerning the three resilience subscales: MST, RLTD, and Grit. These findings have valuable implications for both youth development frameworks and OAE programs, and they further contribute to the expanding literature on grit and resilience development among adolescents.
The improvements in grit, MST and EMO scores post-course underscore the course's efficacy in bolstering certain resilience facets. Previous research has shown that mastering specific tasks and relating positively with peers and adults (akin to the MST dimensions) are pivotal in youth resilience development (Cicchetti, 2016). These findings indicate that OAE programs can be designed or optimized to accentuate these aspects, making them even more robust platforms for youth development. This may be accomplished through activities like learning to light stoves or successfully navigating in the backcountry, common activities in OAE programming.
It is noteworthy that there was considerable variability in effects across the Grit, MST, and EMO subgroups, with the largest standardized effect emerging for the EMO scale. Emotional reactivity and regulation, encompassed within the EMO subscale, can be deeply engrained and appears to be impacted by the OAE program presented in the current research. Van Beveren et al. (2018) suggested that emotionality is a dynamic trait influenced by many factors, including biology, past experiences, and environment. Therefore, OAE programs should consider multi-pronged approaches or extended durations to target and enhance emotional resilience effectively, extending the current effects into longer timeframes.
These data also shed light on the differential impacts of the course based on demographic variables. Gender, for instance, played a role in MST score improvements. This aligns with findings from Overholt and Ewert (2015), who noted gendered variations in coping strategies and resilience trajectories. We also found that older participants had grater shifts in grit, mastery, and relatedness, suggesting that older individuals may be more attuned to garnering the benefits of OAE programs. In contrast, younger participants may need to be targeted with additional preparation before courses to ensure that they are able to reap the course benefits to the fullest. Recognizing demographic differences can allow OAE programs to tailor course design or instructional techniques, ensuring inclusivity and catering to diverse needs.
The relationship between scholarship, indicative of socioeconomic background, and resilience changes is particularly compelling. This project underscores the critical need for acknowledging the diverse backgrounds and individual characteristics that participants contribute to OAE courses. The unique blend of each student's personality, personal history, and life experiences enriches the learning environment. By understanding that youth may follow different paths to resilience, OAE programs can craft tailored and more effective interventions to meet the specific needs of each participant.
Currently, OAE programs are trending towards offering shorter and less rigorous experiences than in the past, with activities like hiking covering fewer miles. Yet, extended or repeated engagements may be essential to influence key areas such as resilience (RLTD) effectively. Such sustained interventions are likely required to realize the developmental benefits OAE aims to provide adolescents. Further, integrating training in emotional intelligence and mindfulness exercises could extend the benefits of OAE programs beyond task mastery and social dynamics. Increasing emphasis is on enhancing staff's social, behavioral, and emotional competencies to meet evolving educational needs.
One limitation to this study is the use of data from 2015. The utilization of 8-year-old data has limitations as well as advantages. The main limitation is that changes in programming or shifts in society may impact these results if this study were duplicated today. However, historical data provides invaluable insights into the evolution of systems over time. By analyzing this legacy data and then repeating this study, this author seeks to identify significant trends and changes that have occurred, offering a richer, more contextual understanding of the current state of OAE. Moreover, old data often serves as a critical resource for testing new hypotheses and validating models, especially in fields where changes are complex and gradual (Elizabeth Griffin, 2015). In essence, leveraging this older data set provides a benchmark enabling us to trace the trajectory of changes in adolescent resilience and grit development through OAE over time (Secondary Use of Existing Data, n.d.).
It should also be noted that, although changes were found using the Bayesian latent change analysis, a latent growth modelling approach with more than two time points could help to establish post-course effects as well as the sustained impact of these courses on resilience scores over a longer period of time. One benefit of Bayesian approaches is that they help to provide more precise estimates of effects—one might consider if an extended growth model might be used more comprehensively in future work in this area to substantiate the evidence found in our current sample. Variation between OAE effects in different locations and with different approaches may help to give clarity as to these nuances as well—a general call for more diverse OAE research is certainly warranted.
This study makes several contributions to understanding how OAE impacts adolescents' grit, and resilience. The research found that participation in OAE significantly increased youth grit, mastery, and emotional regulation, indicative of greater perseverance, competence, and regulation skills. However, relatedness was not meaningfully changed, suggesting extended programming, more training for staff, or alternative treatments may be needed to influence a sense of connection to peers/group leaders.
Based on the findings, it is likely that OAE can effectively develop perseverance, resilience, and positive assets such as relationship building and mastery. This is consistent with previous research, which has established a link between outdoor challenges and favorable outcomes for young people. However, the study showed that the extent and nature of changes varied, indicating that a uniform approach may not be optimal for reaping the benefits. Therefore, it is recommended that programs should create customized designs that target different facets of resilience and include training in emotional skills for instructional staff.
This research study is valuable as it applies the PERMA well-being model to analyze the impacts of OAE. The findings suggest that accomplishment, engagement, and relationships are the key mechanisms for fostering grit and resilience. PERMA provides a multidimensional framework that can be used to guide future curriculum and instruction efforts. It is recommended to conduct longitudinal follow-up to examine the sustainability and durability of the outcomes. Future studies should also examine the impact of course duration and activities included on outcomes and with respect to antecedent variables.
In conclusion, this study suggests that OAE, when designed with a purpose, can effectively instill grit and resilience in teenagers. Programs should utilize challenges, skill development, relationships, and meaningful experiences to offer life-changing opportunities for young people. With careful planning and execution, OAE can become a promising tool for developing perseverance and resilience among the youth, empowering them to overcome challenges and succeed in life.

Conclusions

1 INTRODUCTION
Outdoor adventure education (OAE) programs are becoming increasingly popular to promote positive youth development (Ardoin et al., 2022; Waid & Uhrich, 2019). These programs help young people learn and grow by engaging in outdoor activities and challenges in nature (Ewert & Sibthorp, 2014). Researchers are now investigating the impact of OAE on important traits and outcomes (Ewert & Davidson, 2021; Leonard et al., 2022). This project seeks to add to this narrative by focusing on two such variables: grit, which refers to perseverance and passion toward long-term goals (Duckworth et al., 2007), and resilience, which is the ability to cope effectively with adversity (Masten, 2001). Studies have shown that OAE programs can increase grit and resilience in youth populations (Davidson, 2016; Leonard et al., 2022). However, our understanding of how OAE influences these traits and the pre-existing demographics of those attending OAE programs is still limited.
The study examines how antecedent variables affect adolescents' grit, resilience as a result of participation in an OAE program. The analysis considers the factors that predict changes in these outcome variables, such as age and gender. This research applies the multidimensional PERMA model of well-being (Seligman, 2018) to elucidate mechanisms underlying outcomes. PERMA encompasses positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment. Though studied in education contexts (Kern et al., 2015), PERMA has seen limited application to OAE. Findings from this study will provide insight into how PERMA contributes to grit and resilience changes, expanding theoretical knowledge of how OAE impacts youth development. Further, this study will elucidate how sociodemographic factors contribute to changes in grit and resilience.
1.1 Literature review
The pursuit of understanding grit and resilience has found substantial grounding in both individual research realms, with each construct thoroughly explored through various theories and empirical assessments. By interweaving these domains, this study utilizes data collected from participants at a major OAE program seeking to discern the impact of involvement in these types of experiences on the levels of grit and resilience and what role subject variables play in predicting outcome attainment. The ensuing literature review navigates the pivotal and contemporaneous works related to these constructs, outlining prevailing themes, empirical revelations, and advancements in theory, all within the contextual frame of the PERMA model and OAE programming.
1.2 Outdoor adventure education & PERMA
OAE refers to experiential learning programs that utilize adventure activities in remote outdoor environments, such as backpacking, rock climbing, or kayaking (Ewert & Sibthorp, 2014). OAE programs aim to provide participants with technical skills, leadership development, and opportunities for personal growth, typically on a course lasting five to 90 days with an average length of experience of around 14 days. In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding how participation in OAE may benefit factors related to student success and achievement motivation in addition to other pro-social psychological factors (Blaine & Akhurst, 2020; Mateer et al., 2023).
For example, Overholt and Ewert (2015) examined an OAE program's impact on university students' resilience. Resilience was defined as experiencing growth after a disruptive event. Students completed a questionnaire assessing their resilience levels before and after participating in the adventure program, leisure, or leadership classes. Results showed an interesting interaction effect between gender and time—males reported decreased resilience after the program, while females showed increased resilience. Follow-up interviews suggested this difference may be attributed to variance in self-perception, expectations, and self-assessment between genders entering the program.
Richmond et al. (2018) specifically examined how OAE experiences can develop “noncognitive” skills like grit, self-efficacy, and social skills in adolescents. Students participated in multi-day OAE courses and were later interviewed. OAE increased social connectedness, leadership self-efficacy, and recalibrated sense of self among students. The shared school environment allowed these benefits to be reinforced instead of lost once the program ended, as may be the case with other, shorter-term OAE courses. This study provides evidence that OAE can positively impact academic motivation and perseverance factors, both of which relate to the construct of grit.
Finally, Scrutton and Beames (2015) conducted research in Scotland to provide quantitative evidence that OAE improves personal and social development in children. Students aged 10–12 completed questionnaires before and after a residential OAE experience. A small positive impact was found after the program, but it diminished in 10 weeks, likely because the experience was not integrated into regular schoolwork. Interestingly, students with poorer initial personal and social skills benefited the most from the program. This work is important to the development of this study, given that few other works have tried to highlight predictive factors for successful intervention on these selected variables.
As suggested, the burgeoning body of literature suggests that OAE programs can positively impact noncognitive factors like resilience, grit, self-efficacy, and social skills, which are tied to motivation and achievement. However, gender, initial skill levels, and post-program reinforcement may mediate outcomes. The PERMA model integrates both hedonic and eudaimonic aspects of well-being, making it a valuable framework for assessing psychological health across various contexts and also helps provide a framework for conceptualizing how OAE programming might contribute to youth development.
In the context of OAE, the components of PERMA could represent potential pathways to enhance attributes like grit and resilience. For instance, activities that promote meaning and elicit positive emotions are likely to build resilience, as evidenced in studies by Morgan and Simmons (2021) and similarly by Gloria and Steinhardt (2016). Similarly, the sense of accomplishment from overcoming challenges in OAE could foster perseverance, aligning with the findings of Farmer and Cotter (2021).
The current study aims to fill this gap by implementing and evaluating a PERMA-based OAE program, focusing on its effects on grit, resilience, and the five elements of PERMA. This approach is expected to provide deeper insight into how outdoor adventures may contribute to developing these traits and overall well-being, drawing on the work of Smith et al. (2021) and Ho et al. (2020) in similar contexts. The findings from this study will contribute to our understanding of the PERMA model's effectiveness within OAE and inform efforts to optimize such programs for the comprehensive development of youth.
1.2.1 Grit
In recent years, the concept of grit has gained significant attention among educational researchers and practitioners. Grit refers to having perseverance and passion for long-term goals (Duckworth et al., 2007). In simple terms, grit involves sustaining effort and maintaining determination despite adversity, plateaus, and failure over the course of years or decades. The popularity of grit stems from research showing its association with achievement across domains, including educational attainment, grade point average (GPA), retention in demanding academic programs, and other positive outcomes (Fernández-Martín et al., 2020). Proponents argue grit has potential as an actionable target for interventions aimed at improving student success. However, conceptualization and measurement issues remain, and critics have raised concerns about overemphasizing grit, potentially shifting responsibility away from needed systemic reforms (Credé et al., 2017; Golden, 2017).
Grit was conceptualized as entailing two related but distinct facets: (1) perseverance of effort (working strenuously toward challenges), and (2) consistency of interests (pursuing the same goals and interests over time). Though shorter versions have also been used, Duckworth and Quinn (2009) developed and validated a 12-item Grit Scale with six items tapping each facet. Research found grit was only weakly correlated with IQ but was associated with Big Five conscientiousness, suggesting grit represents a noncognitive attribute distinct from intellectual ability.
Initial studies by Duckworth and colleagues focused on grit predicting success and retention in demanding domains like military training, competitive spelling bees, Ivy League undergraduate programs, and others (Duckworth et al., 2007; Eskreis-Winkler et al., 2014). For example, West Point cadets higher in baseline grit were more likely to complete the rigorous summer training program ('Beast Barracks') and ultimately graduate (Kelly et al., 2014). Grit also emerged as a stronger predictor than IQ or conscientiousness for reaching the final round in the Scripps National Spelling Bee, accounting for differences in accumulated deliberate practice (Duckworth et al., 2011).
Within education, grit has been linked to various positive outcomes, including high school GPA, college GPA, graduation, and intent to persist among diverse samples (Bowman et al., 2015; Strayhorn, 2014) A meta-analysis by Credé et al. (2017) estimated a significant though modest correlation between overall grit scores and academic performance. However, they found that the perseverance facet exhibited substantially stronger links with academic outcomes than consistency of interests. The meta-analysis also showed grit had minimal predictive validity for performance after controlling for conscientiousness.
While correlations do not imply causation, results have sparked interest in interventions to enhance grit. Duckworth et al. (2013) demonstrated that the Mental Contrasting with Implementation Intentions (MCII) strategy significantly improves academic performance in economically disadvantaged fifth graders, compared to traditional positive thinking approaches. Yet few studies have evaluated programs aiming to build grit over months or years. Some charter school networks, such as the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP), have adopted explicit character education focused on grit and self-control. KIPP schools employ core tactics like conspicuously posting character strengths, formally assessing character, and integrating grit concepts into the curriculum (Tough, 2012). Critics argue such intensive behavioral conditioning risks damaging student creativity and emotional well-being (Strauss, 2016). Despite burgeoning interest in grit, conceptual ambiguities persist, including the validity of combining passion and perseverance facets into a single grit construct. The near equivalence of perseverance and Big Five conscientiousness also raises concerns grit is simply conscientiousness rebranded (Credé, 2018; Rimfeld et al., 2016).
More broadly, critics argue grit rhetoric problematically shifts responsibility for inequality onto students and teachers while ignoring social, cultural, and economic structures limiting opportunity (Anderson et al., 2016; Kannangara et al., 2018) Emphasis on noncognitive skills could allow policymakers to minimize material deprivation or discrimination facing marginalized youth. Duckworth has cautioned against grit becoming a panacea or displacing other needed reforms (Duckworth, 2016).
1.2.2 Resilience
The role of OAE in fostering resilience and mental well-being among various populations has been a growing focus in recent literature. Davidson and Ewert's (2024) study on the mental health outcomes of OAE programs, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlights the potential of these programs in enhancing resilience and coping with anxiety and hopelessness. Similarly, Brown et al. (2023) emphasize the efficacy of outdoor programs integrated with mountain biking in enhancing middle school students' resiliency, particularly focusing on the “Sense of Mastery” aspect. These studies collectively underscore the significance of OAE in promoting mental well-being, suggesting their vital role in contemporary educational and therapeutic settings (Brown et al., 2023; Davidson & Ewert, 2024).
Research has also explored the specific impacts of OAE on different demographic groups, revealing a nuanced understanding of how these programs benefit various participants. Talley, Bobilya, and Stonehouse (2023) provide insights into the transformative experiences of adolescent girls in long-term OAE programs, emphasizing the development of leadership skills, resilience, and enjoyment of nature. This focus on gender-specific experiences is further echoed in Tilstra et al., (2022) investigation of gender and risk in OAE, revealing inherent gender biases and stereotypes in risk management and program design. These studies highlight the need for more inclusive and gender-sensitive approaches in OAE to accommodate and leverage the diverse experiences of participants.
The organizational aspect of OAE, particularly in response to external crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, has been another focal point. Rabinowitz et al., (2022) delve into the resilience of OAE organizations during the pandemic, noting the challenges and subsequent adaptations these organizations underwent. Their findings on organizational resilience and effectiveness in crisis management provide a valuable perspective on the need for adaptability and robust planning in OAE programs. This organizational focus is crucial for understanding how OAE can sustain and evolve in the face of global challenges and societal shifts.
Finally, the application of OAE in higher education settings, specifically its impact on new university students' resilience, offers a unique angle to this body of literature. A recent study found that OA residential programs significantly enhance resilience in university inductees, outperforming traditional university-based induction programs (Allan & McKenna, 2019). This gap in the literature regarding the specific role of OAE in youth development contexts is addressed by their work, suggesting that OAE programs can be integral in aiding the transition and adaptation of students to university life. The study thus contributes to the broader discourse on the benefits of OAE in educational settings, highlighting its potential to foster resilience among higher education students.
In sum, the current project aims to contribute to these discussions by exploring the specific impacts of OAE programs on diverse populations, with a particular focus on mental health outcomes like grit and resilience. This project seeks to contribute to this literature by first exploring the impact of OAE programming on resilience. Additionally, this work seeks to illuminate how antecedent variables may impact outcome attainment in OAE participation.
1.2.3 Grit, resilience, and outdoor adventure education
Though distinct, grit and resilience share conceptual overlap. Both constructs emphasize perseverance through challenges and retaining goal-directed effort despite setbacks. Grit may also buffer against the negative effects of stress and build resilience (Datu, 2021). OAE programs may offer a fertile context for developing grit, resilience, and other mental wellness-related variables. Further, what type of OAE participant might most benefit from participation is an important question and the focus of this study.
OAE experiences intentionally expose participants to difficult skill development, physical exertion, uncertainty, and perceived risk (Ewert & Garvey, 2007). These challenges present opportunities to model, build, and reinforce gritty behavior. Reflective processing is used to generalize learning to life outside the course (Baldwin, 2016). For example, Goldenberg et al. (2005) propose the experiential learning cycle of briefing, experience, debriefing, and transfer can instill outcomes like grit and resilience as participants plan goals, attempt challenging tasks, evaluate efforts, and discuss applications and learnings from their OAE experience.
Furthermore, OAE provides strengths-based programming and access to protective factors like caring instructors, supportive peer groups, skill development, and experiences of overcoming obstacles. Research indicates OAE fosters resilience in youth and young adult populations (Kelly, 2019; Soria et al., 2022). Neill and Dias (2001) suggest resilience is enhanced through controlled exposure to risk and adaptive stress in outdoor programs.
In summary, promoting grit and resilience represents viable goals for OAE aligned with its experiential methods. Fostering perseverance and positive adaptation can equip participants to overcome challenges and thrive during and beyond their courses. This study seeks to contribute to the body of literature surrounding the benefits of OAE programming and explore what antecedent variables may mediate changes in selected variables.
1.3 Methods
The study included teenagers aged 14–18 enrolled in selected OAE courses. To participate in the project, the students had to enroll in at least one OAE course of a minimum duration of 5 days, which involved activities like rock climbing and backpacking. All participants were required to provide informed consent via mailed forms and standard informational packets from the host organization. Additionally, minor participants were asked for assent at the beginning of the course. Those who did not provide consent were excluded from participation. The study aimed to have a sample of 350 participants, based on anticipated enrollment figures and previous records from the host institution to ensure sufficient statistical power for subsequent analyses.
Before initiating the study, approval was secured from the host's Institutional Review Board. The research employed a pre/post survey design, with data collection points at the commencement and conclusion of the courses (two separate data collection times). This method, substantiated by existing literature, effectively discerns behavioral shifts post-intervention (Cobb et al., 2003). Surveys were administered by the instructional staff, who also facilitated the student's OAE course.
Grit was assessed using an established inventory comprising two dimensions: interest and effort (Duckworth & Quinn, 2009). Grit. Eight items were used to assess grit—participants were asked to respond to items about how they felt before and after the course on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Items included “I finish whatever I begin” and “New ideas and projects sometimes distract me” (reverse-scored). The scale showed acceptable reliability for both pre- and post-course assessments (Grit Pre α = 0.72; Grit Post α = 0.68).
The Resilience Scales for Children and Adolescents (RSCA) was administered as a pre- and a posttest before and after the OAE course (Prince-Embury, 2008). This instrument is comprised of three subscales: sense of mastery (20 items), sense of relatedness (24 items), and emotional reactivity (20 items) (p. 172). Item responses are in Likert-scale format from 0 (never) to 5 (almost always).
1.3.1 Mastery
Twenty items were used to assess MST—participants were asked to respond to items about how they felt before and after the course on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Items included “I am good at fixing things” and “I can let others help me when I need to”. The scale showed acceptable reliability for both pre- and post-course assessments (MST Pre α = 0.86; MST Post α = 0.91).
1.3.2 Relatedness
Twenty-four items were used to assess RLTD—participants were asked to respond to items about how they felt before and after the course on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Items included “I can calmly tell others that I don't agree with them.” and “can depend on those closest to me to do the right thing”. The scale showed acceptable reliability for both pre- and post-course assessments (RLTD Pre α = 0.92; RLTD Post α = 0.93).
1.3.3 Emotional reactivity
Twenty items were used to assess EMO—participants were asked to respond to items about how they felt before and after the course on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Items included “I get very upset when things don't go my way.” and “When I get upset, I do things that I later feel bad about.” The scale showed acceptable reliability for both pre- and post-course assessments (MST Pre α = 0.86; MST Post α = 0.91).
1.3.4 Sociodemographics
A few primary predictors of changes in course-related outcomes included gender (0 = female, 1 = male), age (grouped as 1 = 12 to 15, 2 = 16-18, 3 = 19-30, 4 = 31 +), ethnicity (0 =  ethnic minority, 1 = White), and socioeconomic status (operationalized by receiving a scholarship; 0 = no, 1 = yes).

A Bayesian approach with latent variables in MPlus version 8.8 (Muthén & Muthén, 2017) was used in this study to assess changes in our outcomes of interest over the span of the course. This approach was used as Bayesian methods do not require distributional assumptions of normality, which would account for potential nonnormality in the distribution of our variables of interest and allow for a more accurate estimate of effects (Yuan & MacKinnon, 2009). The process of assessing our outcomes would, therefore, begin with an assessment of model fit via the measurement model for our 4 pre-intervention and 4-post intervention variables, estimated using a latent variable approach. Then, a method of assessing approximate measurement invariance (AMI) between our pre- and post-course scores will be employed—this approach intends to show that the latent factors for each of our outcomes of interest can be reliably compared to their pre-assessment counterparts. Using the step-by-step approach found in Asparouhov et al. (2015), AMI is assessed by testing which variance value is affiliated with negligible changes in overall fit when compared to the prior variance value. Values often start very low (e.g., υ = 0.001) and slowly increase until the deviance value (DIC) and posterior-predictive p-value (PPP) values do not change in a significant manner. However, as noted in Cain and Zhang (2018), “in larger samples PPP will always reject a model even with minimal misspecification,” suggesting that the p-value in this case is, perhaps, not as informative as our DIC value, which Cain and Zhang (2018) also notes is better at detecting the correct model as samples size increase. Therefore, considering our sample size of well over 500, we have elected to place stronger emphasis on DIC changes between variance levels as a primary indicator of changes in fit.
After assessing AMI, a Bayesian latent growth model will be used to assess changes in the four outcomes of interest, modeling the slope effect between the two time points to assess if there are changes in the scores over the course. Finally, our covariates (age, SES, ethnicity, and participant gender) will be entered as predictors of the slope variable, to assess if different demographic groups had different degrees of change in the four outcomes. A diagram of the schematic overview of the Bayesian Latent Growth Model approach (in this case characterized as a 'Latent Change Model') can be found in Figure 1.

3 RESULTS
Bivariate correlations and descriptive statistics can be found in Table 1. Notably, both pre- and post-course grit scores were related to higher MST scores (rs > 0.28, ps < 0.001), pre- and post-course MST scores were related to higher RLTD scores (rs > 0.54, ps < 0.001), and pre- and post-course grit scores were related to higher RLTD scores as well (rs > 0.25, ps < 0.001). All MST, RLTD, and grit scores were related to lower were related to lower EMO scores (| r | s >  0.13, ps < 0.005). As for predictors, pre-course grit scores were related to having received a scholarship (r = 0.15, p = 0.001) and lower age (r = −0.14, p = 0.002). A similar pattern emerged for MST scores and RLTD scores—higher MST was related to having received a scholarship (r = 0.22, p < 0.001) and lower age (r = −0.19, p < 0.001), and higher RLTD was related to having received a scholarship (r = 0.14, p = 0.003) and lower age (r = −0.18, p < 0.001). Gender was only weakly related to lower post-course MST (r = −0.10, p − 0.039) and RLTD scores (r = −0.10, p = 0.046).

3.1 General model fit
Measurement models were estimated in MPlus for each of the four pairs of variables (e.g., Pre Grit-Post Grit) to assess a general level of model fit. Each of the four models displayed adequate fit (statistics found below in Table 2).

3.2 Approximate measurement invariance
Next, we sought to use a latent variable approach to assess changes in our four outcomes variable over the course. However, we first needed to assess that the latent variables created for our four outcomes were approximately invariant. Therefore, we modelled the pre- and post-course scores for Grit, MST, RLTD, and EMO scales with each of their scale items as indicators and used zero-mean, small-variance priors for the intercepts across time for each of the pairs of latent variables. Variance was slowly increased until only negligible changes in DIC were detected. As shown in Table 3, most of the variables stabilized in their DIC values between υ = 0.010 and υ = 0.050—small-variance priors of υ = 0.100 did not display a meaningful change in model fit when compared to the υ = 0.010 values (or υ = 0.050 in the case of grit). Furthermore, the υ = 0.100 runs required much longer convergence time, further suggesting that υ = 0.010 is generally sufficient to consider minor deviations from exact intercept equivalence, and we can assume that approximate scalar MI holds in this case. Approximate measurement invariance allows us to make more confident conclusions based on the interpretation of the latent means for the pre- and post-course assessment scores.

υ = 0.100 19302.17 38157.24 46735.13 41110.86
Note: Bolded DIC values show where DIC estimates stabilized.
A latent growth approach was next used to assess changes in the latent factors for each of the four outcomes over the two time points. This approach models the intercept and slope of the pre and post course assessment, with the slope indicating the increase in the outcome over one unit increase in time. In this case, with only two time points, the post-course assessment was set as the second time point, so a significant slope would indicate a difference in pre- and post-course course scores.1
3.3 Model specification
The Bayesian change models were estimated using priors on intercepts, factor loadings, and slopes with 3 chain sequences set in MPlus. Although little work has been done specifically targeting resilience, a prior study looking to boost resilience using outdoor physical activity programs in Malaysia was used as a potential source for more strongly informed priors of the standardized mean differences between pre- and post-intervention scores. In their study, Samsudin et al. (2021) found a small effect size based on the mean scores reported, so an informative prior was used for the slope's distribution to be centered around 0.15 with a 0.10 variance to represent a small effect size. As for variances, little information can be found in the literature on intercept values for such studies, so a generic weakly informative priors for variance used normally-distributed, zero-mean, small-variance informative priors for the intercepts (variance of 1). As for regression coefficients, once again, little prior work has been conducted on predictors of OAE resilience program success, although work from Allan et al. (2024) recently found small-to-moderate effects sizes for gender differences in OAE program outcomes—the Cohen's d effects were ~.46 in this study. Potential significant effects were presumed to be similar effect sizes, although there was less confidence in these effects as with the slope, which had a somewhat analogous correlate in prior work. Therefore, regression coefficient distributions were centered around 0.30 with a 1.0 variance.
Convergence parameters will be reported using the iterations output found in the TECH8 section of MPlus, which reports the potential scale reduction value (PSR). This value is expected to be closer to 1, wich indicates a lower likelihood that the weighted average of between-chain and within-chain variances has not converged, although the value being less than 1.10 is a cutoff generally used in the literature (Gelman et al., 2004). An unconditional model was employed by fixing the first factor loading at 0 and the second factor loading at 1. The slope, in this case, would represent the change from the pre-intervention measurement to the post-intervention measurement. Autocorrelation plots were observed in MPlus to search for the potential that autocorrelation diminished the effective sample—each estimate in MCMC is correlated with previous estimates, but plots should indicate that autocorrelation values hover around a somewhat consistent mean score after an initial spike.
Model estimation was carried out effectively, with each of the four outcomes producing PSR values under 1.10. Furthermore, autocorrelation plots suggested that issues with autocorrelation were minimal (example autocorrelation plots pulled from MPlus into R can be found in the Supplemental File). Convergence statistics and slope values can be found in Table 4 below.
Table 4. Convergence statistics and slope values for the four outcomes.
PSR Value Slope Parameter Esimate Slope Posterior SD Slope p-value
Grit 1.09 0.77 0.28 <0.001
MST 1.10 1.57 0.31 <0.001
RLTD 1.08 0.02 0.01 <0.001
EMO 1.04 0.01 0.002 <0.001
The slope for MST was significant (β = 0.07, [0.01, 0.99], p = 0.002) as was the slope for the EMO outcome (β = 0.69, [0.02, 2.06], p < 0.001). The slope for Grit was significant via the directional p-value (β = 0.37, [−0.05, 1.68], p = 0.044). The slope for RLTD was not statistically significant (β = 0.001, [−0.055, 0.067], p = 0.469). A full list of parameter estimates can be found in the Supplemental File.
Finally, effects were estimated in MPlus for age, SES, ethnicity, and participant gender predicting the slope for each of the four outcomes—significant effects would suggest that the variable significantly predicts the extent to which the course elicited changes in the outcome variable of interest. For the grit outcome, SES was not significantly linked with the slope of change (βSES = −0.04 [−0.40, 0.28], p = 0.411)—women, white participants, and older participants tended to have higher increases in grit scores, although these effects only approached significance (βGENDER = −0.15 [−0.62, 0.26], p = 0.201; βETNC = 0.20, [−0.12, 0.72], p = 0.112; βAGE = 0.16, [−0.21, 0.66], p = 0.183). For the MST outcome, older participants, higher SES participants, and white partiicpants tended to have higher rates of change (βAGE = 0.54 [0.22, 0.89], p < 0.001; βSES = 0.27, [−0.03, 0.62], p = 0.036; βETNC = 0.33, [0.05, 0.70], p = 0.011)—women tended to have greater increases in MST scores, although this effect only approached significance (βGENDER = −0.23 [−0.60, 0.09], p = 0.072). For RLTD scores, gender and SES did not predict changes in scores (βGENDER = −0.05 [−0.39, 0.25], p = 0.364; βSES = 0.17, [−0.10, 0.47], p = 0.104)—older participants and white participants tended to have significantly higher change in RLTD (βAGE = 0.56, [0.29, 0.83], p < 0.001; βETNC = 0.52, [0.22, 0.79], p < 0.001). Older participants tended to show greater change in EMO scores (βAGE = 0.15, [−0.02, 0.35], p = 0.046)— participants from higher SES backgrounds, women, and white participants tended to show greater change in EMO scores, though thse effects were not statstically significant (βSES = 0.09 [−0.09, 0.31], p = 0.156; βGENDER = −0.07 [−0.30, 0.14], p = 0.265; βETNC = 0.08, [−0.11, 0.32], p = 0.205).
4 DISCUSSION
The data from this study offers compelling insights into the impact of specific course interventions on youth development, particularly concerning the three resilience subscales: MST, RLTD, and Grit. These findings have valuable implications for both youth development frameworks and OAE programs, and they further contribute to the expanding literature on grit and resilience development among adolescents.
The improvements in grit, MST and EMO scores post-course underscore the course's efficacy in bolstering certain resilience facets. Previous research has shown that mastering specific tasks and relating positively with peers and adults (akin to the MST dimensions) are pivotal in youth resilience development (Cicchetti, 2016). These findings indicate that OAE programs can be designed or optimized to accentuate these aspects, making them even more robust platforms for youth development. This may be accomplished through activities like learning to light stoves or successfully navigating in the backcountry, common activities in OAE programming.
It is noteworthy that there was considerable variability in effects across the Grit, MST, and EMO subgroups, with the largest standardized effect emerging for the EMO scale. Emotional reactivity and regulation, encompassed within the EMO subscale, can be deeply engrained and appears to be impacted by the OAE program presented in the current research. Van Beveren et al. (2018) suggested that emotionality is a dynamic trait influenced by many factors, including biology, past experiences, and environment. Therefore, OAE programs should consider multi-pronged approaches or extended durations to target and enhance emotional resilience effectively, extending the current effects into longer timeframes.
These data also shed light on the differential impacts of the course based on demographic variables. Gender, for instance, played a role in MST score improvements. This aligns with findings from Overholt and Ewert (2015), who noted gendered variations in coping strategies and resilience trajectories. We also found that older participants had grater shifts in grit, mastery, and relatedness, suggesting that older individuals may be more attuned to garnering the benefits of OAE programs. In contrast, younger participants may need to be targeted with additional preparation before courses to ensure that they are able to reap the course benefits to the fullest. Recognizing demographic differences can allow OAE programs to tailor course design or instructional techniques, ensuring inclusivity and catering to diverse needs.
The relationship between scholarship, indicative of socioeconomic background, and resilience changes is particularly compelling. This project underscores the critical need for acknowledging the diverse backgrounds and individual characteristics that participants contribute to OAE courses. The unique blend of each student's personality, personal history, and life experiences enriches the learning environment. By understanding that youth may follow different paths to resilience, OAE programs can craft tailored and more effective interventions to meet the specific needs of each participant.
Currently, OAE programs are trending towards offering shorter and less rigorous experiences than in the past, with activities like hiking covering fewer miles. Yet, extended or repeated engagements may be essential to influence key areas such as resilience (RLTD) effectively. Such sustained interventions are likely required to realize the developmental benefits OAE aims to provide adolescents. Further, integrating training in emotional intelligence and mindfulness exercises could extend the benefits of OAE programs beyond task mastery and social dynamics. Increasing emphasis is on enhancing staff's social, behavioral, and emotional competencies to meet evolving educational needs.
One limitation to this study is the use of data from 2015. The utilization of 8-year-old data has limitations as well as advantages. The main limitation is that changes in programming or shifts in society may impact these results if this study were duplicated today. However, historical data provides invaluable insights into the evolution of systems over time. By analyzing this legacy data and then repeating this study, this author seeks to identify significant trends and changes that have occurred, offering a richer, more contextual understanding of the current state of OAE. Moreover, old data often serves as a critical resource for testing new hypotheses and validating models, especially in fields where changes are complex and gradual (Elizabeth Griffin, 2015). In essence, leveraging this older data set provides a benchmark enabling us to trace the trajectory of changes in adolescent resilience and grit development through OAE over time (Secondary Use of Existing Data, n.d.).
It should also be noted that, although changes were found using the Bayesian latent change analysis, a latent growth modelling approach with more than two time points could help to establish post-course effects as well as the sustained impact of these courses on resilience scores over a longer period of time. One benefit of Bayesian approaches is that they help to provide more precise estimates of effects—one might consider if an extended growth model might be used more comprehensively in future work in this area to substantiate the evidence found in our current sample. Variation between OAE effects in different locations and with different approaches may help to give clarity as to these nuances as well—a general call for more diverse OAE research is certainly warranted.
This study makes several contributions to understanding how OAE impacts adolescents' grit, and resilience. The research found that participation in OAE significantly increased youth grit, mastery, and emotional regulation, indicative of greater perseverance, competence, and regulation skills. However, relatedness was not meaningfully changed, suggesting extended programming, more training for staff, or alternative treatments may be needed to influence a sense of connection to peers/group leaders.
Based on the findings, it is likely that OAE can effectively develop perseverance, resilience, and positive assets such as relationship building and mastery. This is consistent with previous research, which has established a link between outdoor challenges and favorable outcomes for young people. However, the study showed that the extent and nature of changes varied, indicating that a uniform approach may not be optimal for reaping the benefits. Therefore, it is recommended that programs should create customized designs that target different facets of resilience and include training in emotional skills for instructional staff.
This research study is valuable as it applies the PERMA well-being model to analyze the impacts of OAE. The findings suggest that accomplishment, engagement, and relationships are the key mechanisms for fostering grit and resilience. PERMA provides a multidimensional framework that can be used to guide future curriculum and instruction efforts. It is recommended to conduct longitudinal follow-up to examine the sustainability and durability of the outcomes. Future studies should also examine the impact of course duration and activities included on outcomes and with respect to antecedent variables.
In conclusion, this study suggests that OAE, when designed with a purpose, can effectively instill grit and resilience in teenagers. Programs should utilize challenges, skill development, relationships, and meaningful experiences to offer life-changing opportunities for young people. With careful planning and execution, OAE can become a promising tool for developing perseverance and resilience among the youth, empowering them to overcome challenges and succeed in life.

1 INTRODUCTION
Outdoor adventure education (OAE) programs are becoming increasingly popular to promote positive youth development (Ardoin et al., 2022; Waid & Uhrich, 2019). These programs help young people learn and grow by engaging in outdoor activities and challenges in nature (Ewert & Sibthorp, 2014). Researchers are now investigating the impact of OAE on important traits and outcomes (Ewert & Davidson, 2021; Leonard et al., 2022). This project seeks to add to this narrative by focusing on two such variables: grit, which refers to perseverance and passion toward long-term goals (Duckworth et al., 2007), and resilience, which is the ability to cope effectively with adversity (Masten, 2001). Studies have shown that OAE programs can increase grit and resilience in youth populations (Davidson, 2016; Leonard et al., 2022). However, our understanding of how OAE influences these traits and the pre-existing demographics of those attending OAE programs is still limited.
The study examines how antecedent variables affect adolescents' grit, resilience as a result of participation in an OAE program. The analysis considers the factors that predict changes in these outcome variables, such as age and gender. This research applies the multidimensional PERMA model of well-being (Seligman, 2018) to elucidate mechanisms underlying outcomes. PERMA encompasses positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment. Though studied in education contexts (Kern et al., 2015), PERMA has seen limited application to OAE. Findings from this study will provide insight into how PERMA contributes to grit and resilience changes, expanding theoretical knowledge of how OAE impacts youth development. Further, this study will elucidate how sociodemographic factors contribute to changes in grit and resilience.
1.1 Literature review
The pursuit of understanding grit and resilience has found substantial grounding in both individual research realms, with each construct thoroughly explored through various theories and empirical assessments. By interweaving these domains, this study utilizes data collected from participants at a major OAE program seeking to discern the impact of involvement in these types of experiences on the levels of grit and resilience and what role subject variables play in predicting outcome attainment. The ensuing literature review navigates the pivotal and contemporaneous works related to these constructs, outlining prevailing themes, empirical revelations, and advancements in theory, all within the contextual frame of the PERMA model and OAE programming.
1.2 Outdoor adventure education & PERMA
OAE refers to experiential learning programs that utilize adventure activities in remote outdoor environments, such as backpacking, rock climbing, or kayaking (Ewert & Sibthorp, 2014). OAE programs aim to provide participants with technical skills, leadership development, and opportunities for personal growth, typically on a course lasting five to 90 days with an average length of experience of around 14 days. In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding how participation in OAE may benefit factors related to student success and achievement motivation in addition to other pro-social psychological factors (Blaine & Akhurst, 2020; Mateer et al., 2023).
For example, Overholt and Ewert (2015) examined an OAE program's impact on university students' resilience. Resilience was defined as experiencing growth after a disruptive event. Students completed a questionnaire assessing their resilience levels before and after participating in the adventure program, leisure, or leadership classes. Results showed an interesting interaction effect between gender and time—males reported decreased resilience after the program, while females showed increased resilience. Follow-up interviews suggested this difference may be attributed to variance in self-perception, expectations, and self-assessment between genders entering the program.
Richmond et al. (2018) specifically examined how OAE experiences can develop “noncognitive” skills like grit, self-efficacy, and social skills in adolescents. Students participated in multi-day OAE courses and were later interviewed. OAE increased social connectedness, leadership self-efficacy, and recalibrated sense of self among students. The shared school environment allowed these benefits to be reinforced instead of lost once the program ended, as may be the case with other, shorter-term OAE courses. This study provides evidence that OAE can positively impact academic motivation and perseverance factors, both of which relate to the construct of grit.
Finally, Scrutton and Beames (2015) conducted research in Scotland to provide quantitative evidence that OAE improves personal and social development in children. Students aged 10–12 completed questionnaires before and after a residential OAE experience. A small positive impact was found after the program, but it diminished in 10 weeks, likely because the experience was not integrated into regular schoolwork. Interestingly, students with poorer initial personal and social skills benefited the most from the program. This work is important to the development of this study, given that few other works have tried to highlight predictive factors for successful intervention on these selected variables.
As suggested, the burgeoning body of literature suggests that OAE programs can positively impact noncognitive factors like resilience, grit, self-efficacy, and social skills, which are tied to motivation and achievement. However, gender, initial skill levels, and post-program reinforcement may mediate outcomes. The PERMA model integrates both hedonic and eudaimonic aspects of well-being, making it a valuable framework for assessing psychological health across various contexts and also helps provide a framework for conceptualizing how OAE programming might contribute to youth development.
In the context of OAE, the components of PERMA could represent potential pathways to enhance attributes like grit and resilience. For instance, activities that promote meaning and elicit positive emotions are likely to build resilience, as evidenced in studies by Morgan and Simmons (2021) and similarly by Gloria and Steinhardt (2016). Similarly, the sense of accomplishment from overcoming challenges in OAE could foster perseverance, aligning with the findings of Farmer and Cotter (2021).
The current study aims to fill this gap by implementing and evaluating a PERMA-based OAE program, focusing on its effects on grit, resilience, and the five elements of PERMA. This approach is expected to provide deeper insight into how outdoor adventures may contribute to developing these traits and overall well-being, drawing on the work of Smith et al. (2021) and Ho et al. (2020) in similar contexts. The findings from this study will contribute to our understanding of the PERMA model's effectiveness within OAE and inform efforts to optimize such programs for the comprehensive development of youth.
1.2.1 Grit
In recent years, the concept of grit has gained significant attention among educational researchers and practitioners. Grit refers to having perseverance and passion for long-term goals (Duckworth et al., 2007). In simple terms, grit involves sustaining effort and maintaining determination despite adversity, plateaus, and failure over the course of years or decades. The popularity of grit stems from research showing its association with achievement across domains, including educational attainment, grade point average (GPA), retention in demanding academic programs, and other positive outcomes (Fernández-Martín et al., 2020). Proponents argue grit has potential as an actionable target for interventions aimed at improving student success. However, conceptualization and measurement issues remain, and critics have raised concerns about overemphasizing grit, potentially shifting responsibility away from needed systemic reforms (Credé et al., 2017; Golden, 2017).
Grit was conceptualized as entailing two related but distinct facets: (1) perseverance of effort (working strenuously toward challenges), and (2) consistency of interests (pursuing the same goals and interests over time). Though shorter versions have also been used, Duckworth and Quinn (2009) developed and validated a 12-item Grit Scale with six items tapping each facet. Research found grit was only weakly correlated with IQ but was associated with Big Five conscientiousness, suggesting grit represents a noncognitive attribute distinct from intellectual ability.
Initial studies by Duckworth and colleagues focused on grit predicting success and retention in demanding domains like military training, competitive spelling bees, Ivy League undergraduate programs, and others (Duckworth et al., 2007; Eskreis-Winkler et al., 2014). For example, West Point cadets higher in baseline grit were more likely to complete the rigorous summer training program ('Beast Barracks') and ultimately graduate (Kelly et al., 2014). Grit also emerged as a stronger predictor than IQ or conscientiousness for reaching the final round in the Scripps National Spelling Bee, accounting for differences in accumulated deliberate practice (Duckworth et al., 2011).
Within education, grit has been linked to various positive outcomes, including high school GPA, college GPA, graduation, and intent to persist among diverse samples (Bowman et al., 2015; Strayhorn, 2014) A meta-analysis by Credé et al. (2017) estimated a significant though modest correlation between overall grit scores and academic performance. However, they found that the perseverance facet exhibited substantially stronger links with academic outcomes than consistency of interests. The meta-analysis also showed grit had minimal predictive validity for performance after controlling for conscientiousness.
While correlations do not imply causation, results have sparked interest in interventions to enhance grit. Duckworth et al. (2013) demonstrated that the Mental Contrasting with Implementation Intentions (MCII) strategy significantly improves academic performance in economically disadvantaged fifth graders, compared to traditional positive thinking approaches. Yet few studies have evaluated programs aiming to build grit over months or years. Some charter school networks, such as the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP), have adopted explicit character education focused on grit and self-control. KIPP schools employ core tactics like conspicuously posting character strengths, formally assessing character, and integrating grit concepts into the curriculum (Tough, 2012). Critics argue such intensive behavioral conditioning risks damaging student creativity and emotional well-being (Strauss, 2016). Despite burgeoning interest in grit, conceptual ambiguities persist, including the validity of combining passion and perseverance facets into a single grit construct. The near equivalence of perseverance and Big Five conscientiousness also raises concerns grit is simply conscientiousness rebranded (Credé, 2018; Rimfeld et al., 2016).
More broadly, critics argue grit rhetoric problematically shifts responsibility for inequality onto students and teachers while ignoring social, cultural, and economic structures limiting opportunity (Anderson et al., 2016; Kannangara et al., 2018) Emphasis on noncognitive skills could allow policymakers to minimize material deprivation or discrimination facing marginalized youth. Duckworth has cautioned against grit becoming a panacea or displacing other needed reforms (Duckworth, 2016).
1.2.2 Resilience
The role of OAE in fostering resilience and mental well-being among various populations has been a growing focus in recent literature. Davidson and Ewert's (2024) study on the mental health outcomes of OAE programs, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlights the potential of these programs in enhancing resilience and coping with anxiety and hopelessness. Similarly, Brown et al. (2023) emphasize the efficacy of outdoor programs integrated with mountain biking in enhancing middle school students' resiliency, particularly focusing on the “Sense of Mastery” aspect. These studies collectively underscore the significance of OAE in promoting mental well-being, suggesting their vital role in contemporary educational and therapeutic settings (Brown et al., 2023; Davidson & Ewert, 2024).
Research has also explored the specific impacts of OAE on different demographic groups, revealing a nuanced understanding of how these programs benefit various participants. Talley, Bobilya, and Stonehouse (2023) provide insights into the transformative experiences of adolescent girls in long-term OAE programs, emphasizing the development of leadership skills, resilience, and enjoyment of nature. This focus on gender-specific experiences is further echoed in Tilstra et al., (2022) investigation of gender and risk in OAE, revealing inherent gender biases and stereotypes in risk management and program design. These studies highlight the need for more inclusive and gender-sensitive approaches in OAE to accommodate and leverage the diverse experiences of participants.
The organizational aspect of OAE, particularly in response to external crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, has been another focal point. Rabinowitz et al., (2022) delve into the resilience of OAE organizations during the pandemic, noting the challenges and subsequent adaptations these organizations underwent. Their findings on organizational resilience and effectiveness in crisis management provide a valuable perspective on the need for adaptability and robust planning in OAE programs. This organizational focus is crucial for understanding how OAE can sustain and evolve in the face of global challenges and societal shifts.
Finally, the application of OAE in higher education settings, specifically its impact on new university students' resilience, offers a unique angle to this body of literature. A recent study found that OA residential programs significantly enhance resilience in university inductees, outperforming traditional university-based induction programs (Allan & McKenna, 2019). This gap in the literature regarding the specific role of OAE in youth development contexts is addressed by their work, suggesting that OAE programs can be integral in aiding the transition and adaptation of students to university life. The study thus contributes to the broader discourse on the benefits of OAE in educational settings, highlighting its potential to foster resilience among higher education students.
In sum, the current project aims to contribute to these discussions by exploring the specific impacts of OAE programs on diverse populations, with a particular focus on mental health outcomes like grit and resilience. This project seeks to contribute to this literature by first exploring the impact of OAE programming on resilience. Additionally, this work seeks to illuminate how antecedent variables may impact outcome attainment in OAE participation.
1.2.3 Grit, resilience, and outdoor adventure education
Though distinct, grit and resilience share conceptual overlap. Both constructs emphasize perseverance through challenges and retaining goal-directed effort despite setbacks. Grit may also buffer against the negative effects of stress and build resilience (Datu, 2021). OAE programs may offer a fertile context for developing grit, resilience, and other mental wellness-related variables. Further, what type of OAE participant might most benefit from participation is an important question and the focus of this study.
OAE experiences intentionally expose participants to difficult skill development, physical exertion, uncertainty, and perceived risk (Ewert & Garvey, 2007). These challenges present opportunities to model, build, and reinforce gritty behavior. Reflective processing is used to generalize learning to life outside the course (Baldwin, 2016). For example, Goldenberg et al. (2005) propose the experiential learning cycle of briefing, experience, debriefing, and transfer can instill outcomes like grit and resilience as participants plan goals, attempt challenging tasks, evaluate efforts, and discuss applications and learnings from their OAE experience.
Furthermore, OAE provides strengths-based programming and access to protective factors like caring instructors, supportive peer groups, skill development, and experiences of overcoming obstacles. Research indicates OAE fosters resilience in youth and young adult populations (Kelly, 2019; Soria et al., 2022). Neill and Dias (2001) suggest resilience is enhanced through controlled exposure to risk and adaptive stress in outdoor programs.
In summary, promoting grit and resilience represents viable goals for OAE aligned with its experiential methods. Fostering perseverance and positive adaptation can equip participants to overcome challenges and thrive during and beyond their courses. This study seeks to contribute to the body of literature surrounding the benefits of OAE programming and explore what antecedent variables may mediate changes in selected variables.
1.3 Methods
The study included teenagers aged 14–18 enrolled in selected OAE courses. To participate in the project, the students had to enroll in at least one OAE course of a minimum duration of 5 days, which involved activities like rock climbing and backpacking. All participants were required to provide informed consent via mailed forms and standard informational packets from the host organization. Additionally, minor participants were asked for assent at the beginning of the course. Those who did not provide consent were excluded from participation. The study aimed to have a sample of 350 participants, based on anticipated enrollment figures and previous records from the host institution to ensure sufficient statistical power for subsequent analyses.
Before initiating the study, approval was secured from the host's Institutional Review Board. The research employed a pre/post survey design, with data collection points at the commencement and conclusion of the courses (two separate data collection times). This method, substantiated by existing literature, effectively discerns behavioral shifts post-intervention (Cobb et al., 2003). Surveys were administered by the instructional staff, who also facilitated the student's OAE course.
Grit was assessed using an established inventory comprising two dimensions: interest and effort (Duckworth & Quinn, 2009). Grit. Eight items were used to assess grit—participants were asked to respond to items about how they felt before and after the course on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Items included “I finish whatever I begin” and “New ideas and projects sometimes distract me” (reverse-scored). The scale showed acceptable reliability for both pre- and post-course assessments (Grit Pre α = 0.72; Grit Post α = 0.68).
The Resilience Scales for Children and Adolescents (RSCA) was administered as a pre- and a posttest before and after the OAE course (Prince-Embury, 2008). This instrument is comprised of three subscales: sense of mastery (20 items), sense of relatedness (24 items), and emotional reactivity (20 items) (p. 172). Item responses are in Likert-scale format from 0 (never) to 5 (almost always).
1.3.1 Mastery
Twenty items were used to assess MST—participants were asked to respond to items about how they felt before and after the course on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Items included “I am good at fixing things” and “I can let others help me when I need to”. The scale showed acceptable reliability for both pre- and post-course assessments (MST Pre α = 0.86; MST Post α = 0.91).
1.3.2 Relatedness
Twenty-four items were used to assess RLTD—participants were asked to respond to items about how they felt before and after the course on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Items included “I can calmly tell others that I don't agree with them.” and “can depend on those closest to me to do the right thing”. The scale showed acceptable reliability for both pre- and post-course assessments (RLTD Pre α = 0.92; RLTD Post α = 0.93).
1.3.3 Emotional reactivity
Twenty items were used to assess EMO—participants were asked to respond to items about how they felt before and after the course on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Items included “I get very upset when things don't go my way.” and “When I get upset, I do things that I later feel bad about.” The scale showed acceptable reliability for both pre- and post-course assessments (MST Pre α = 0.86; MST Post α = 0.91).
1.3.4 Sociodemographics
A few primary predictors of changes in course-related outcomes included gender (0 = female, 1 = male), age (grouped as 1 = 12 to 15, 2 = 16-18, 3 = 19-30, 4 = 31 +), ethnicity (0 =  ethnic minority, 1 = White), and socioeconomic status (operationalized by receiving a scholarship; 0 = no, 1 = yes).

1 INTRODUCTION

1.1 Literature review
The pursuit of understanding grit and resilience has found substantial grounding in both individual research realms, with each construct thoroughly explored through various theories and empirical assessments. By interweaving these domains, this study utilizes data collected from participants at a major OAE program seeking to discern the impact of involvement in these types of experiences on the levels of grit and resilience and what role subject variables play in predicting outcome attainment. The ensuing literature review navigates the pivotal and contemporaneous works related to these constructs, outlining prevailing themes, empirical revelations, and advancements in theory, all within the contextual frame of the PERMA model and OAE programming.

1.1 Literature review

1.2 Outdoor adventure education & PERMA
OAE refers to experiential learning programs that utilize adventure activities in remote outdoor environments, such as backpacking, rock climbing, or kayaking (Ewert & Sibthorp, 2014). OAE programs aim to provide participants with technical skills, leadership development, and opportunities for personal growth, typically on a course lasting five to 90 days with an average length of experience of around 14 days. In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding how participation in OAE may benefit factors related to student success and achievement motivation in addition to other pro-social psychological factors (Blaine & Akhurst, 2020; Mateer et al., 2023).
For example, Overholt and Ewert (2015) examined an OAE program's impact on university students' resilience. Resilience was defined as experiencing growth after a disruptive event. Students completed a questionnaire assessing their resilience levels before and after participating in the adventure program, leisure, or leadership classes. Results showed an interesting interaction effect between gender and time—males reported decreased resilience after the program, while females showed increased resilience. Follow-up interviews suggested this difference may be attributed to variance in self-perception, expectations, and self-assessment between genders entering the program.
Richmond et al. (2018) specifically examined how OAE experiences can develop “noncognitive” skills like grit, self-efficacy, and social skills in adolescents. Students participated in multi-day OAE courses and were later interviewed. OAE increased social connectedness, leadership self-efficacy, and recalibrated sense of self among students. The shared school environment allowed these benefits to be reinforced instead of lost once the program ended, as may be the case with other, shorter-term OAE courses. This study provides evidence that OAE can positively impact academic motivation and perseverance factors, both of which relate to the construct of grit.
Finally, Scrutton and Beames (2015) conducted research in Scotland to provide quantitative evidence that OAE improves personal and social development in children. Students aged 10–12 completed questionnaires before and after a residential OAE experience. A small positive impact was found after the program, but it diminished in 10 weeks, likely because the experience was not integrated into regular schoolwork. Interestingly, students with poorer initial personal and social skills benefited the most from the program. This work is important to the development of this study, given that few other works have tried to highlight predictive factors for successful intervention on these selected variables.
As suggested, the burgeoning body of literature suggests that OAE programs can positively impact noncognitive factors like resilience, grit, self-efficacy, and social skills, which are tied to motivation and achievement. However, gender, initial skill levels, and post-program reinforcement may mediate outcomes. The PERMA model integrates both hedonic and eudaimonic aspects of well-being, making it a valuable framework for assessing psychological health across various contexts and also helps provide a framework for conceptualizing how OAE programming might contribute to youth development.
In the context of OAE, the components of PERMA could represent potential pathways to enhance attributes like grit and resilience. For instance, activities that promote meaning and elicit positive emotions are likely to build resilience, as evidenced in studies by Morgan and Simmons (2021) and similarly by Gloria and Steinhardt (2016). Similarly, the sense of accomplishment from overcoming challenges in OAE could foster perseverance, aligning with the findings of Farmer and Cotter (2021).
The current study aims to fill this gap by implementing and evaluating a PERMA-based OAE program, focusing on its effects on grit, resilience, and the five elements of PERMA. This approach is expected to provide deeper insight into how outdoor adventures may contribute to developing these traits and overall well-being, drawing on the work of Smith et al. (2021) and Ho et al. (2020) in similar contexts. The findings from this study will contribute to our understanding of the PERMA model's effectiveness within OAE and inform efforts to optimize such programs for the comprehensive development of youth.
1.2.1 Grit
In recent years, the concept of grit has gained significant attention among educational researchers and practitioners. Grit refers to having perseverance and passion for long-term goals (Duckworth et al., 2007). In simple terms, grit involves sustaining effort and maintaining determination despite adversity, plateaus, and failure over the course of years or decades. The popularity of grit stems from research showing its association with achievement across domains, including educational attainment, grade point average (GPA), retention in demanding academic programs, and other positive outcomes (Fernández-Martín et al., 2020). Proponents argue grit has potential as an actionable target for interventions aimed at improving student success. However, conceptualization and measurement issues remain, and critics have raised concerns about overemphasizing grit, potentially shifting responsibility away from needed systemic reforms (Credé et al., 2017; Golden, 2017).
Grit was conceptualized as entailing two related but distinct facets: (1) perseverance of effort (working strenuously toward challenges), and (2) consistency of interests (pursuing the same goals and interests over time). Though shorter versions have also been used, Duckworth and Quinn (2009) developed and validated a 12-item Grit Scale with six items tapping each facet. Research found grit was only weakly correlated with IQ but was associated with Big Five conscientiousness, suggesting grit represents a noncognitive attribute distinct from intellectual ability.
Initial studies by Duckworth and colleagues focused on grit predicting success and retention in demanding domains like military training, competitive spelling bees, Ivy League undergraduate programs, and others (Duckworth et al., 2007; Eskreis-Winkler et al., 2014). For example, West Point cadets higher in baseline grit were more likely to complete the rigorous summer training program ('Beast Barracks') and ultimately graduate (Kelly et al., 2014). Grit also emerged as a stronger predictor than IQ or conscientiousness for reaching the final round in the Scripps National Spelling Bee, accounting for differences in accumulated deliberate practice (Duckworth et al., 2011).
Within education, grit has been linked to various positive outcomes, including high school GPA, college GPA, graduation, and intent to persist among diverse samples (Bowman et al., 2015; Strayhorn, 2014) A meta-analysis by Credé et al. (2017) estimated a significant though modest correlation between overall grit scores and academic performance. However, they found that the perseverance facet exhibited substantially stronger links with academic outcomes than consistency of interests. The meta-analysis also showed grit had minimal predictive validity for performance after controlling for conscientiousness.
While correlations do not imply causation, results have sparked interest in interventions to enhance grit. Duckworth et al. (2013) demonstrated that the Mental Contrasting with Implementation Intentions (MCII) strategy significantly improves academic performance in economically disadvantaged fifth graders, compared to traditional positive thinking approaches. Yet few studies have evaluated programs aiming to build grit over months or years. Some charter school networks, such as the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP), have adopted explicit character education focused on grit and self-control. KIPP schools employ core tactics like conspicuously posting character strengths, formally assessing character, and integrating grit concepts into the curriculum (Tough, 2012). Critics argue such intensive behavioral conditioning risks damaging student creativity and emotional well-being (Strauss, 2016). Despite burgeoning interest in grit, conceptual ambiguities persist, including the validity of combining passion and perseverance facets into a single grit construct. The near equivalence of perseverance and Big Five conscientiousness also raises concerns grit is simply conscientiousness rebranded (Credé, 2018; Rimfeld et al., 2016).
More broadly, critics argue grit rhetoric problematically shifts responsibility for inequality onto students and teachers while ignoring social, cultural, and economic structures limiting opportunity (Anderson et al., 2016; Kannangara et al., 2018) Emphasis on noncognitive skills could allow policymakers to minimize material deprivation or discrimination facing marginalized youth.

1.3 Methods
The study included teenagers aged 14–18 enrolled in selected OAE courses. To participate in the project, the students had to enroll in at least one OAE course of a minimum duration of 5 days, which involved activities like rock climbing and backpacking.

Items included “I get very upset when things don't go my way.” and “When I get upset, I do things that I later feel bad about.” The scale showed acceptable reliability for both pre- and post-course assessments (MST Pre α = 0.86; MST Post α = 0.91).
1.3.4 Sociodemographics
A few primary predictors of changes in course-related outcomes included gender (0 = female, 1 = male), age (grouped as 1 = 12 to 15, 2 = 16-18, 3 = 19-30, 4 = 31 +), ethnicity (0 =  ethnic minority, 1 = White), and socioeconomic status (operationalized by receiving a scholarship; 0 = no, 1 = yes).

2 ANALYTIC STRATEGY
A Bayesian approach with latent variables in MPlus version 8.8 (Muthén & Muthén, 2017) was used in this study to assess changes in our outcomes of interest over the span of the course. This approach was used as Bayesian methods do not require distributional assumptions of normality, which would account for potential nonnormality in the distribution of our variables of interest and allow for a more accurate estimate of effects (Yuan & MacKinnon, 2009). The process of assessing our outcomes would, therefore, begin with an assessment of model fit via the measurement model for our 4 pre-intervention and 4-post intervention variables, estimated using a latent variable approach. Then, a method of assessing approximate measurement invariance (AMI) between our pre- and post-course scores will be employed—this approach intends to show that the latent factors for each of our outcomes of interest can be reliably compared to their pre-assessment counterparts. Using the step-by-step approach found in Asparouhov et al. (2015), AMI is assessed by testing which variance value is affiliated with negligible changes in overall fit when compared to the prior variance value. Values often start very low (e.g., υ = 0.001) and slowly increase until the deviance value (DIC) and posterior-predictive p-value (PPP) values do not change in a significant manner. However, as noted in Cain and Zhang (2018), “in larger samples PPP will always reject a model even with minimal misspecification,” suggesting that the p-value in this case is, perhaps, not as informative as our DIC value, which Cain and Zhang (2018) also notes is better at detecting the correct model as samples size increase. Therefore, considering our sample size of well over 500, we have elected to place stronger emphasis on DIC changes between variance levels as a primary indicator of changes in fit.
After assessing AMI, a Bayesian latent growth model will be used to assess changes in the four outcomes of interest, modeling the slope effect between the two time points to assess if there are changes in the scores over the course. Finally, our covariates (age, SES, ethnicity, and participant gender) will be entered as predictors of the slope variable, to assess if different demographic groups had different degrees of change in the four outcomes. A diagram of the schematic overview of the Bayesian Latent Growth Model approach (in this case characterized as a 'Latent Change Model') can be found in Figure 1.

3 RESULTS
Bivariate correlations and descriptive statistics can be found in Table 1. Notably, both pre- and post-course grit scores were related to higher MST scores (rs > 0.28, ps < 0.001), pre- and post-course MST scores were related to higher RLTD scores (rs > 0.54, ps < 0.001), and pre- and post-course grit scores were related to higher RLTD scores as well (rs > 0.25, ps < 0.001). All MST, RLTD, and grit scores were related to lower were related to lower EMO scores (| r | s >  0.13, ps < 0.005). As for predictors, pre-course grit scores were related to having received a scholarship (r = 0.15, p = 0.001) and lower age (r = −0.14, p = 0.002). A similar pattern emerged for MST scores and RLTD scores—higher MST was related to having received a scholarship (r = 0.22, p < 0.001) and lower age (r = −0.19, p < 0.001), and higher RLTD was related to having received a scholarship (r = 0.14, p = 0.003) and lower age (r = −0.18, p < 0.001). Gender was only weakly related to lower post-course MST (r = −0.10, p − 0.039) and RLTD scores (r = −0.10, p = 0.046).

3.2 Approximate measurement invariance
Next, we sought to use a latent variable approach to assess changes in our four outcomes variable over the course. However, we first needed to assess that the latent variables created for our four outcomes were approximately invariant. Therefore, we modelled the pre- and post-course scores for Grit, MST, RLTD, and EMO scales with each of their scale items as indicators and used zero-mean, small-variance priors for the intercepts across time for each of the pairs of latent variables. Variance was slowly increased until only negligible changes in DIC were detected. As shown in Table 3, most of the variables stabilized in their DIC values between υ = 0.010 and υ = 0.050—small-variance priors of υ = 0.100 did not display a meaningful change in model fit when compared to the υ = 0.010 values (or υ = 0.050 in the case of grit). Furthermore, the υ = 0.100 runs required much longer convergence time, further suggesting that υ = 0.010 is generally sufficient to consider minor deviations from exact intercept equivalence, and we can assume that approximate scalar MI holds in this case. Approximate measurement invariance allows us to make more confident conclusions based on the interpretation of the latent means for the pre- and post-course assessment scores.

Note: Bolded DIC values show where DIC estimates stabilized.
A latent growth approach was next used to assess changes in the latent factors for each of the four outcomes over the two time points. This approach models the intercept and slope of the pre and post course assessment, with the slope indicating the increase in the outcome over one unit increase in time. In this case, with only two time points, the post-course assessment was set as the second time point, so a significant slope would indicate a difference in pre- and post-course course scores.1
3.3 Model specification
The Bayesian change models were estimated using priors on intercepts, factor loadings, and slopes with 3 chain sequences set in MPlus. Although little work has been done specifically targeting resilience, a prior study looking to boost resilience using outdoor physical activity programs in Malaysia was used as a potential source for more strongly informed priors of the standardized mean differences between pre- and post-intervention scores. In their study, Samsudin et al. (2021) found a small effect size based on the mean scores reported, so an informative prior was used for the slope's distribution to be centered around 0.15 with a 0.10 variance to represent a small effect size. As for variances, little information can be found in the literature on intercept values for such studies, so a generic weakly informative priors for variance used normally-distributed, zero-mean, small-variance informative priors for the intercepts (variance of 1). As for regression coefficients, once again, little prior work has been conducted on predictors of OAE resilience program success, although work from Allan et al. (2024) recently found small-to-moderate effects sizes for gender differences in OAE program outcomes—the Cohen's d effects were ~.46 in this study. Potential significant effects were presumed to be similar effect sizes, although there was less confidence in these effects as with the slope, which had a somewhat analogous correlate in prior work. Therefore, regression coefficient distributions were centered around 0.30 with a 1.0 variance.
Convergence parameters will be reported using the iterations output found in the TECH8 section of MPlus, which reports the potential scale reduction value (PSR). This value is expected to be closer to 1, wich indicates a lower likelihood that the weighted average of between-chain and within-chain variances has not converged, although the value being less than 1.10 is a cutoff generally used in the literature (Gelman et al., 2004). An unconditional model was employed by fixing the first factor loading at 0 and the second factor loading at 1. The slope, in this case, would represent the change from the pre-intervention measurement to the post-intervention measurement. Autocorrelation plots were observed in MPlus to search for the potential that autocorrelation diminished the effective sample—each estimate in MCMC is correlated with previous estimates, but plots should indicate that autocorrelation values hover around a somewhat consistent mean score after an initial spike.
Model estimation was carried out effectively, with each of the four outcomes producing PSR values under 1.10. Furthermore, autocorrelation plots suggested that issues with autocorrelation were minimal (example autocorrelation plots pulled from MPlus into R can be found in the Supplemental File). Convergence statistics and slope values can be found in Table 4 below.
Table 4. Convergence statistics and slope values for the four outcomes.

RLTD 1.08 0.02 0.01 <0.001
EMO 1.04 0.01 0.002 <0.001
The slope for MST was significant (β = 0.07, [0.01, 0.99], p = 0.002) as was the slope for the EMO outcome (β = 0.69, [0.02, 2.06], p < 0.001). The slope for Grit was significant via the directional p-value (β = 0.37, [−0.05, 1.68], p = 0.044). The slope for RLTD was not statistically significant (β = 0.001, [−0.055, 0.067], p = 0.469). A full list of parameter estimates can be found in the Supplemental File.
Finally, effects were estimated in MPlus for age, SES, ethnicity, and participant gender predicting the slope for each of the four outcomes—significant effects would suggest that the variable significantly predicts the extent to which the course elicited changes in the outcome variable of interest. For the grit outcome, SES was not significantly linked with the slope of change (βSES = −0.04 [−0.40, 0.28], p = 0.411)—women, white participants, and older participants tended to have higher increases in grit scores, although these effects only approached significance (βGENDER = −0.15 [−0.62, 0.26], p = 0.201; βETNC = 0.20, [−0.12, 0.72], p = 0.112; βAGE = 0.16, [−0.21, 0.66], p = 0.183). For the MST outcome, older participants, higher SES participants, and white partiicpants tended to have higher rates of change (βAGE = 0.54 [0.22, 0.89], p < 0.001; βSES = 0.27, [−0.03, 0.62], p = 0.036; βETNC = 0.33, [0.05, 0.70], p = 0.011)—women tended to have greater increases in MST scores, although this effect only approached significance (βGENDER = −0.23 [−0.60, 0.09], p = 0.072). For RLTD scores, gender and SES did not predict changes in scores (βGENDER = −0.05 [−0.39, 0.25], p = 0.364; βSES = 0.17, [−0.10, 0.47], p = 0.104)—older participants and white participants tended to have significantly higher change in RLTD (βAGE = 0.56, [0.29, 0.83], p < 0.001; βETNC = 0.52, [0.22, 0.79], p < 0.001). Older participants tended to show greater change in EMO scores (βAGE = 0.15, [−0.02, 0.35], p = 0.046)— participants from higher SES backgrounds, women, and white participants tended to show greater change in EMO scores, though thse effects were not statstically significant (βSES = 0.09 [−0.09, 0.31], p = 0.156; βGENDER = −0.07 [−0.30, 0.14], p = 0.265; βETNC = 0.08, [−0.11, 0.32], p = 0.205).

3.2 Approximate measurement invariance
Next, we sought to use a latent variable approach to assess changes in our four outcomes variable over the course. However, we first needed to assess that the latent variables created for our four outcomes were approximately invariant. Therefore, we modelled the pre- and post-course scores for Grit, MST, RLTD, and EMO scales with each of their scale items as indicators and used zero-mean, small-variance priors for the intercepts across time for each of the pairs of latent variables. Variance was slowly increased until only negligible changes in DIC were detected. As shown in Table 3, most of the variables stabilized in their DIC values between υ = 0.010 and υ = 0.050—small-variance priors of υ = 0.100 did not display a meaningful change in model fit when compared to the υ = 0.010 values (or υ = 0.050 in the case of grit). Furthermore, the υ = 0.100 runs required much longer convergence time, further suggesting that υ = 0.010 is generally sufficient to consider minor deviations from exact intercept equivalence, and we can assume that approximate scalar MI holds in this case. Approximate measurement invariance allows us to make more confident conclusions based on the interpretation of the latent means for the pre- and post-course assessment scores.

For the MST outcome, older participants, higher SES participants, and white partiicpants tended to have higher rates of change (βAGE = 0.54 [0.22, 0.89], p < 0.001; βSES = 0.27, [−0.03, 0.62], p = 0.036; βETNC = 0.33, [0.05, 0.70], p = 0.011)—women tended to have greater increases in MST scores, although this effect only approached significance (βGENDER = −0.23 [−0.60, 0.09], p = 0.072). For RLTD scores, gender and SES did not predict changes in scores (βGENDER = −0.05 [−0.39, 0.25], p = 0.364; βSES = 0.17, [−0.10, 0.47], p = 0.104)—older participants and white participants tended to have significantly higher change in RLTD (βAGE = 0.56, [0.29, 0.83], p < 0.001; βETNC = 0.52, [0.22, 0.79], p < 0.001). Older participants tended to show greater change in EMO scores (βAGE = 0.15, [−0.02, 0.35], p = 0.046)— participants from higher SES backgrounds, women, and white participants tended to show greater change in EMO scores, though thse effects were not statstically significant (βSES = 0.09 [−0.09, 0.31], p = 0.156; βGENDER = −0.07 [−0.30, 0.14], p = 0.265; βETNC = 0.08, [−0.11, 0.32], p = 0.205).

4 DISCUSSION
The data from this study offers compelling insights into the impact of specific course interventions on youth development, particularly concerning the three resilience subscales: MST, RLTD, and Grit. These findings have valuable implications for both youth development frameworks and OAE programs, and they further contribute to the expanding literature on grit and resilience development among adolescents.
The improvements in grit, MST and EMO scores post-course underscore the course's efficacy in bolstering certain resilience facets. Previous research has shown that mastering specific tasks and relating positively with peers and adults (akin to the MST dimensions) are pivotal in youth resilience development (Cicchetti, 2016). These findings indicate that OAE programs can be designed or optimized to accentuate these aspects, making them even more robust platforms for youth development. This may be accomplished through activities like learning to light stoves or successfully navigating in the backcountry, common activities in OAE programming.
It is noteworthy that there was considerable variability in effects across the Grit, MST, and EMO subgroups, with the largest standardized effect emerging for the EMO scale. Emotional reactivity and regulation, encompassed within the EMO subscale, can be deeply engrained and appears to be impacted by the OAE program presented in the current research. Van Beveren et al. (2018) suggested that emotionality is a dynamic trait influenced by many factors, including biology, past experiences, and environment. Therefore, OAE programs should consider multi-pronged approaches or extended durations to target and enhance emotional resilience effectively, extending the current effects into longer timeframes.
These data also shed light on the differential impacts of the course based on demographic variables. Gender, for instance, played a role in MST score improvements. This aligns with findings from Overholt and Ewert (2015), who noted gendered variations in coping strategies and resilience trajectories. We also found that older participants had grater shifts in grit, mastery, and relatedness, suggesting that older individuals may be more attuned to garnering the benefits of OAE programs. In contrast, younger participants may need to be targeted with additional preparation before courses to ensure that they are able to reap the course benefits to the fullest. Recognizing demographic differences can allow OAE programs to tailor course design or instructional techniques, ensuring inclusivity and catering to diverse needs.
The relationship between scholarship, indicative of socioeconomic background, and resilience changes is particularly compelling. This project underscores the critical need for acknowledging the diverse backgrounds and individual characteristics that participants contribute to OAE courses. The unique blend of each student's personality, personal history, and life experiences enriches the learning environment. By understanding that youth may follow different paths to resilience, OAE programs can craft tailored and more effective interventions to meet the specific needs of each participant.
Currently, OAE programs are trending towards offering shorter and less rigorous experiences than in the past, with activities like hiking covering fewer miles. Yet, extended or repeated engagements may be essential to influence key areas such as resilience (RLTD) effectively. Such sustained interventions are likely required to realize the developmental benefits OAE aims to provide adolescents. Further, integrating training in emotional intelligence and mindfulness exercises could extend the benefits of OAE programs beyond task mastery and social dynamics. Increasing emphasis is on enhancing staff's social, behavioral, and emotional competencies to meet evolving educational needs.
One limitation to this study is the use of data from 2015. The utilization of 8-year-old data has limitations as well as advantages. The main limitation is that changes in programming or shifts in society may impact these results if this study were duplicated today. However, historical data provides invaluable insights into the evolution of systems over time. By analyzing this legacy data and then repeating this study, this author seeks to identify significant trends and changes that have occurred, offering a richer, more contextual understanding of the current state of OAE. Moreover, old data often serves as a critical resource for testing new hypotheses and validating models, especially in fields where changes are complex and gradual (Elizabeth Griffin, 2015). In essence, leveraging this older data set provides a benchmark enabling us to trace the trajectory of changes in adolescent resilience and grit development through OAE over time (Secondary Use of Existing Data, n.d.).
It should also be noted that, although changes were found using the Bayesian latent change analysis, a latent growth modelling approach with more than two time points could help to establish post-course effects as well as the sustained impact of these courses on resilience scores over a longer period of time. One benefit of Bayesian approaches is that they help to provide more precise estimates of effects—one might consider if an extended growth model might be used more comprehensively in future work in this area to substantiate the evidence found in our current sample. Variation between OAE effects in different locations and with different approaches may help to give clarity as to these nuances as well—a general call for more diverse OAE research is certainly warranted.
This study makes several contributions to understanding how OAE impacts adolescents' grit, and resilience. The research found that participation in OAE significantly increased youth grit, mastery, and emotional regulation, indicative of greater perseverance, competence, and regulation skills. However, relatedness was not meaningfully changed, suggesting extended programming, more training for staff, or alternative treatments may be needed to influence a sense of connection to peers/group leaders.
Based on the findings, it is likely that OAE can effectively develop perseverance, resilience, and positive assets such as relationship building and mastery. This is consistent with previous research, which has established a link between outdoor challenges and favorable outcomes for young people. However, the study showed that the extent and nature of changes varied, indicating that a uniform approach may not be optimal for reaping the benefits. Therefore, it is recommended that programs should create customized designs that target different facets of resilience and include training in emotional skills for instructional staff.
This research study is valuable as it applies the PERMA well-being model to analyze the impacts of OAE. The findings suggest that accomplishment, engagement, and relationships are the key mechanisms for fostering grit and resilience. PERMA provides a multidimensional framework that can be used to guide future curriculum and instruction efforts. It is recommended to conduct longitudinal follow-up to examine the sustainability and durability of the outcomes. Future studies should also examine the impact of course duration and activities included on outcomes and with respect to antecedent variables.
In conclusion, this study suggests that OAE, when designed with a purpose, can effectively instill grit and resilience in teenagers. Programs should utilize challenges, skill development, relationships, and meaningful experiences to offer life-changing opportunities for young people. With careful planning and execution, OAE can become a promising tool for developing perseverance and resilience among the youth, empowering them to overcome challenges and succeed in life.
