ABSTRACT
The Williams LifeSkills® (WLS) anger and stress
management workshop provides training in strategies to
cope with stressful situations and build supportive
relationships. The purpose of this study was to determine
the impact of school-based Williams LifeSkills training on
anger, anxiety, and blood pressure in adolescents. One
hundred fifty-nine adolescents (mean age±SD=15.7±
1.4 years) were randomized to WLS (n=86) or control
(CTL, n=73) groups. The WLS group engaged in twelve 50-
min WLS training sessions conducted by teachers at
school. Anger-in and anxiety scores decreased and angercontrol scores increased in the WLS group across the sixmonth follow-up period compared to the CTL group (group
xvisit, ps<0.05). Daytime diastolic BP was lower across
the follow-up in the WLS group (p=0.08). DBP was
significantly lower across the follow-up period in the WLS
group among those with higher SBP at baseline (p=0.04).
These findings demonstrate beneficial impact of WLS
upon self-reported anger-in, anger control, anxiety levels,
and ambulatory DBP in the natural environment in healthy
normotensive youth.

INTRODUCTION
Essential hypertension (EH) is no longer considered
an adult disease due to escalation in prevalence in
recent years among youth [1]. The pathogenesis of EH
has its origins in childhood [2]. Psychosocial factors
(such as anger and anxiety) have been shown to be
related to elevated blood pressure (BP) in adolescents
[3]. The escalating prevalence of anger and violence in
our youth has been associated with increased levels of
anxiety and stress [4]. Self-reported feelings of anger
have been shown to be predictive of aggression in
youth [5]. Anger may contribute to health problems
through its influences on several coronary risk factors
across the life span [6, 7].
Behavioral and psychosocial interventions have
been shown to reduce risk factors and negative health
effects [8], reducing EH in a number of trials in adults
[9], and have been examined for their impact in youth
showing effectiveness in the treatment of physiological, psychosocial, and behavioral conditions [10]. The
role of behavioral interventions in reducing psychosocial and cardiovascular (CV) risk factors among
youth needs to be further explored [11–13]. Problems
among young people such as anger (leading to
violence) and negative school behaviors may be
addressed by promoting lifestyle change toward
healthy habits, improving stress-related coping skills,
and reducing psychosocial risk factors related to
mental and physical health problems, which collectively may improve both academic performance and
behavior [14]. The challenge is to develop programs
that are well-standardized, protocol-driven, schoolbased, and deliverable by teachers on a broad scale
[15, 16].
The Williams LifeSkills (WLS) workshop provides training in anger and stress management and
stress-related coping skills [17]. Strategies and
approaches employed in the WLS workshop were
drawn from previous research on the role of
psychosocial factors in health and disease, the

method is available to deliver anger and stress
management through coping skills training to
high school students.

effects of personality and behavior on health and
quality of life, and the application of behavioral
approaches to the treatment of medical illness. The
WLS curriculum [17, 18] is based on a wellresearched program with extensive field testing and
development in adults with studies conducted with
coronary heart disease patients, hypertensives, Alzheimer's disease family caregivers, and healthy
subjects in worksite settings. There is evidence that
WLS training can lower BP, improve overall health
and well being, and reduce hostility and anger in
adults, but it has not been evaluated in adolescents.
A randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining the
impact of WLS training on psychosocial and CVD risk
factors in men with heart disease documented reductions in hostility and diastolic BP (DBP) [18], as well as
medical care costs [19], over a 6-month follow-up. In
another RCT targeting men following coronary
bypass graft surgery, the WLS workshop produced
significant improvements in depression, trait anger,
satisfaction with life, resting systolic BP (SBP), and SBP
response to an anger recall task compared to usual care
[20]. An RCT targeting hypertensive employees at a
large urban medical center found significantly larger
SBP reductions in those receiving WLS training than
those randomized to usual care [21]. A controlled trial
evaluating the WLS Video adapted for caregivers of a
relative with Alzheimer's disease documented larger
reductions in perceived stress, anxiety, depression,
SBP, and DBP in those in the WLS video group
compared to wait list controls that were maintained or
enhanced over a 6-month follow-up period [22]. An
observational trial of the WLS workshop among 110
employees at multiple worksites of a corporate client
produced significant reductions in depression, hostility, and anxiety that were maintained or enhanced
over a 6-month follow-up period [23]. As documented
in these studies, the WLS training program for adults
had evolved based on scientific evidence for efficacy
from RCTs and effectiveness in real-world applications ranging from individuals in stressful life situations to corporations, government agencies, and
healthcare facilities.
The purpose of this translational study was to train
school teachers to deliver WLS training in a realworld classroom setting and examine the impact of
WLS training on measures of anger, anxiety, and BP
in adolescents. The rationale for the involvement of
adolescents is that, as noted above, a need exists for
programs that are consistent with a primary prevention approach to avert disease in future years and
can be delivered on a mass scale early in the
pathogenic process. This rationale provides a theoretical framework that underpins the study.
METHODS
Subjects
Written informed consent was obtained for 258
adolescents (mean age±SD=15.7±1.4 years, 47 %
males, 86 % African American) who were randomly
assigned to WLS (n=135) or CTL (n=123) groups.
No race/ethnicity groups were excluded. The ninth
grade was targeted on the basis of our previous
experience conducting BP-lowering health education programs within the school curriculum.
Study design
This was a randomized, single-blind study that
enrolled students at two local high schools in Augusta
GA across 2 years. Both schools had students enrolled
in health education classes in one of two ninth grade
semesters. There are two semesters per year (Fall and
Spring). School “A” was randomly chosen for year 1
(Fall and Spring semesters) and school “B” for year 2
(Fall and Spring semesters). Within school “A”, for the
Fall and Spring semesters, six ninth grade classes were
enrolled in health education classes. The six health
classes were randomly assigned to receive either the
WLS workshop or a health education control (CTL)
condition, i.e., three classes received the WLS workshop, and three classes were assigned to CTL. During
each semester, subjects from each class (balanced by
gender) were randomly chosen from each of the six
classrooms for testing. The first semester cohort
intervention (cohort 1, n=65) was conducted via
weekly sessions over nearly 3 months. Data from this
cohort was not included in this analysis because
feedback from the health education and physical
education teachers suggested that it would be better
to conduct the intervention on consecutive school
days. Therefore, the three following cohorts 2–4 (n=
193) were given the intervention in this manner. Data
analysis was completed for 193 subjects in cohorts 2–4,
103 WLS, and 90 CTL. Of these, 16 moved and 1
dropped out in the WLS group and 16 moved and 1
was incarcerated in the CTL group and were unable to
finish the study, leaving a final sample of 159.
Psychosocial and BP variables were assessed at pretraining (visit 1), within 1-week post-intervention (visit
2), at 3-month (visit 3) and 6-month (visit 4) follow-up.
All participants were assessed regardless of group
assignment (WLS or CTL condition). This procedure
was repeated in year 2 in school “B”. One hundred
twenty-two subjects (cohorts 1 and 2) were enrolled in
school A for Fall and Spring semesters, respectively,
and 136 subjects (cohorts 3 and 4) were enrolled in
school B for Fall and Spring semesters, respectively
(Fig. 1). The study was single-blinded as it was not
possible to blind the subjects to the intervention. The
Human Assurance Committee of the Medical College
of Georgia approved the study as of 8/2005.
Williams LifeSkills Intervention
The WLS training program was adapted for adolescents and provides training in stress-related coping
skills. The ten skill modules that comprise the WLS
program were sequenced in sessions such that basic
skills were taught first, as they continued to be applied
as other skills are layered on in later skill modules. The
ten WLS modules were organized to achieve two

goals, the first being to cope more effectively with
stressful situations: (1) Being Aware. Students were
taught to view a situation objectively and become
aware of thoughts and feelings, e.g., by using log
entries from their own experiences. (2) Making Decisions. Students were taught to evaluate negative
thoughts, feelings, and options by introducing questions which help decide whether to take action or try to
overcome negative thoughts or feelings. (3) Getting
Over It: Overcoming Unwanted Negative Thoughts and
Feelings. “Deflection skills”, such as reasoning with
oneself, thought stopping, distraction, and stress
management through relaxation and simple meditation were taught. (4) Problem Solving: Discovering
Solutions to Problems. A model was introduced to
enhance creative problem-solving abilities in situations where evaluation tools indicate that problem
solving is the best option. Students were taught to
decide what needs to be changed (defining the
problem precisely) and how to go about changing the
situation. (5) Assertion: Standing Up for Yourself. Students
were taught how to become more assertive (without
being aggressive) and get what they want without
infringing upon the rights of others. (6) Saying “NO”.
When others made requests, students decided to do
what they ask or say “No”. Students were taught how
to evaluate whether they want to say “No” and if so,
how to make that “No” hold fast.
The second set of skills has the goal of increasing
interpersonal skills to reduce the likelihood of

stressful situations occurring: (7) Speaking up. Many
of the problems faced in life require speaking to
another person in order to reach a solution. Students
were taught ways to speak up and be listened to
without being abrasive. (8) Listening. Students were
taught effective listening (via practice exercises)—
which includes keeping quiet while the other person
is talking, using body language to convey interest,
reflecting back what is heard and being open to
being changed by what is heard. (9) Empathy.
Students were taught empathy (via practice exercises)—that there are many perspectives other than
one's own, which helps to improve relationships.
(10) Increasing Positives. Students were taught to
increase positive interactions and decrease negative
ones. The workshop did not explicitly address
changes in personal belief, lifestyle, or philosophy.
Upon completion of the curriculum, students had
available to them an array of tools to better evaluate
and cope with stressful life situations. If one
response strategy did not work, students learned to
cycle back through the evaluation process and
choose an alternative approach. In this way, the
workshop addressed development of effective stressrelated coping skills and to have beneficial influences
on a variety of physical health and behavioral
indicators. The teacher explained the rationale for
each skill and its use. The use of each skill was
modeled with an example, which could be personal or
drawn from the teacher's manual. The WLS group
engaged in 12 50-min training sessions conducted
during health or physical education classes led by
WLS-trained teachers in the school. Participants
practiced the skills, either with examples from their
lives via in-session exercises or from role-play examples provided in the curriculum materials. Homework
(10 min) was assigned to practice the skills before next
session. At each session, students reported on how the
homework practice went or practiced another roleplay example.
The scheduling was designed such that WLS
workshop sessions and evaluations would not interfere with school testing or important class activities.
Participation in the study was voluntary and subjects
were paid $30 for each testing evaluation. These
disbursements were in addition to free instruction in
the WLS program. WLS participants also received a
free WLS workbook. After the intervention period,
subjects were encouraged to continue with their
regular practice of the WLS program.
WLS teacher training
Sessions were facilitated by a WLS-trained school
teachers. The intervention instructors were ninthgrade health education or physical education
instructors at two schools. Instructors participated
in a 5-day (8 h per day) WLS training program in
which the first 2 days involved participation in the
workshop and the following 3 days involved training to facilitate the ten LifeSkills modules. Teachers
were reimbursed ($1,500) for their time in training, for
providing interviews, written comments, and for
participating in focus groups. The teachers were
trained using previously developed standardized
materials. A Facilitator's Manual, slides, and laminated
role-playing option cards for WLS were developed
along with a student workbook for the workshop [24].
During the course of the WLS intervention, sessions
were monitored via audio recordings to assess whether
various components of each session were correctly
implemented, allowing constructive feedback and
retraining when needed.
Health Education (CTL) condition
To provide a credible control for the time and
attention received by the WLS groups, the CTL
groups were randomly selected by class in each
health education or physical education class at
school and did not receive instructions in any
specific stress- or anger-management techniques.
Teachers for the health-education CTL group sessions were trained in a credible array of BP-lowering
lifestyle strategies including physical activity and
diet that may improve CV health. Subjects assigned
to CTL groups were then instructed regarding these
lifestyle strategies.
Psychosocial measures
All participants, regardless of group assignment,
were evaluated by research personnel from the
Georgia Health Sciences University. Instruments
were chosen that were validated for adolescents
and administered within the school schedule. Subjects completed the Spielberger Anger Expression
Scale [25, 26] (24 items; anger-in, anger-out, and
anger control); and the Basic Assessment System for
Children; anxiety subscale [27]. Evaluations were
planned so as not to interfere with important school
activities, such as testing.
Ambulatory BP monitoring
Ambulatory BP measurements were obtained over
24-h periods in the natural setting using SpaceLabs
90207 BP monitors at pre- (visit 1) and postintervention (visits 2–4). The SpaceLabs 90207
ABP monitor (SpaceLabs, Inc., Redmond, WA) has
been well-documented for its technical validity in
children [28–31] and has shown good reproducibility [32]. Findings in youth have indicated that
ambulatory SBP is stable across periods of time
varying from 1 to 4 years [33]. An appropriate sized
BP cuff was selected and attached to the monitor
with the cuff placed on the non-dominant arm. The
monitors were programmed so that BP readings
were taken every 30 min at school (i.e., 8 AM to
3 PM), and every 20 min after school (i.e., 3 PM to
10 PM) and at night (i.e., 10 PM to 6 AM). Similar to
previous studies [32, 34], data for transition periods
(6 to 8 AM and 10 PM to midnight) were excluded
from daytime and nighttime calculations and outlier

measurements of SBP <50 mmHg and DBP
<30 mmHg were deleted. Data were reduced by
averaging individual measures into daytime and
nighttime levels. Means for SBP, DBP, and heart
rate required a minimum of 50 % of the total
possible observations (i.e., minimum of 21 daytime
and 6 nighttime measures) to be included in the
analyses. Subjects were instructed to follow their
normal daily routine without modification.
Statistical analyses
The study was a two-group (WLS vs. CTL) design with
repeated measures. The normality of errors has been
confirmed for all variables by analysis of the residuals.
The correlation between the observations and the
possibility of nonconstant variance has been modeled
using a mixed model repeated measures analysis and
an unstructured variance-covariance matrix for the
errors. A mixed model repeated measures ANCOVA
was used to analyze data from visits 2, 3, and 4 (1 week
after end of training, and at 3- and 6-month follow-up
visits) using visit 1 (baseline) as a covariate in the
model. The model also contained the covariates of
cohort, age, and sex, as well as group (WLS vs. CTL),
visit (2, 3, or 4), and the group×visit interaction.
The variables analyzed were the questionnaire
data assessing anger indices, anxiety, and ambulatory
BP measures (24 h, daytime and nighttime).
The results from both the group×visit interaction
and the overall group effects were considered tests of
interest. Since baseline was used as a covariate, if there
was an overall group effect for visits 2, 3, and 4, that
would indicate that the WLS group was different than
CTL across all of the post-training visits, a significant
group×visit interaction would indicate that the WLS
and CTL groups varied differently across post-training
visits, which would also be of interest when evaluating
the intervention. Individuals who had at least one posttest value but did not complete the study were not
excluded, and values that were missing were not
imputed. SAS® 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC)
was used for all analyses, and statistical significance
was assessed at p<0.05.
RESULTS
In order to be included in the mixed model
ANCOVA analysis, subjects had to have data
collected at baseline and at least one other visit.
Demographic and baseline psychosocial and ambulatory BP characteristics of the subjects who met this
requirement are presented in Table 1.
There were no significant differences between the
groups for these measures (all ps>0.13). The sample
size was 91 in the WLS group (46 % male, 81 %
black) and 79 in the CTL group (32 % male, 91 %
black). No adverse events were reported during the
study, except for one subject in the CTL group who
was incarcerated and not able to finish the study.
Psychosocial outcomes
There were no significant group effects for psychosocial outcomes, indicating that psychosocial scores
across the three follow-up visits did not differ as a
function of group assignment (Table 2).
There were significant group×visit interactions for
anger-in (p=0.05), anger control (p=0.02), and anxiety
(p=0.01). As shown in Fig. 2, the adjusted anger-in
score was significantly higher for the WLS group at the
first post-training visit (visit 2, p=0.01) and decreased
to lower levels at visits 3 and 4; in contrast, anger-in
scores increased to higher levels at visits 3 and 4 in the
CTL group. Anger control scores increased from visit
2 to visit 4 in the WLS group but remained about the
same level in the CTL group (Fig. 3). Anxiety scores
decreased from visit 2 to visit 3 and remained at about
the same level for visit 4 in the WLS group, while the
CTL group did not fall to a comparably low level until
visit 4 compared to visits 2 and 3 (Fig. 4).

Blood pressure outcomes
There were no significant group by time interactions
across the three visits adjusted for baseline for 24 h,
daytime, or nighttime SBP or DBP (Table 2, all ps>
0.33). As predicted, SBP and DBP levels were lower in
the WLS group than CTLs for both 24-h and daytime
levels across follow-up visits, but the group effect
reached the trend level only for the lower daytime
DBP in the WLS group (least square means±SE; 71.6±
0.36 vs. 70.7±0.35, p=0.083). A barrier to detecting
treatment effects on BP in the current study is the
potential for a floor effect to underestimate BP
reductions in a normotensive sample with mean 24-
h SBP/DBP less than 120/70 mmHg [35]. To overcome
this difficulty, a BP subgroup analysis based on high
baseline SBP (≥124 mmHg for boys and ≥117 for girls;
n=32 for WLS, n=19 for CTL) versus low baseline
SBP (<124 mmHg for boys and <117 for girls; n=59
for WLS, n=60 for CTL) was used to further analyze
the trending results for the overall group effect for
daytime DBP. These SBP cutoff values were selected
based on pediatric ABPM reference values of mean
day- and nighttime SBP according to gender and height
values previously published [36]. The same model was
used as above except that the analyses were performed
separately for each baseline SBP group (high or low).
When the data were analyzed within baseline SBP
subgroups, the WLS group had significantly lower
(72.7±0.7 vs. 74.9±0.9 mmHg) daytime DBP than the
CTL group (p=0.04) in the high BP subgroup, but there
was no significant difference (69.8±0.4 vs. 70.2±0.4)
between WLS and CTL (p=0.46) for the Low BP
subgroup (Fig. 5). The group effect for SBP was not
statistically significant (p<0.11).
DISCUSSION
Study findings demonstrate the feasibility of training
health education and physical education teachers to
deliver the WLS program to ninth grade students in
the public high school setting. Study findings also
provide preliminary evidence that WLS training
delivered by trained teachers in this setting has the
potential to reduce anger-in and anxiety levels,
increase anger control levels, and reduce daytime
BP levels, especially in those students with higher
baseline BP. Importantly, these effects were maintained or extended over a 6-month follow-up
following only 12 50-min training sessions. To our
knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled
study to evaluate the impact of stress management
training upon BP and indices of anger and anxiety
among adolescents in the school setting. Although
the present findings are promising, they should not
be over-interpreted and will require replication with
a larger sample of youth.
Subjects with at least one post-test value as well as
baseline were considered in the analysis, so the
results are only significant for those who completed
at least one post-test visit. One of the problems

contamination, that is, students in separate classes in
the intervention groups influencing the CTL group
and vice versa. This contamination is considered
“random error" that may dilute the treatment effect
resulting in more conservative findings. This problem of contamination was minimized in the current
study by randomly assigning the classes to treatment
and randomly assigning subjects from within each
class to WLS training or a credible health education
CTL condition. This gave each student an equal
opportunity to expect to be improved in the
variables of interest, making the current findings a
conservative estimate of the benefits of WLS
training compared to an absolute (no treatment)
CTL. In the current design, schools were chosen
and classes within schools received the WLS and
CTL workshops on a randomly selected basis.
During each year, only one school was involved.
This further reduced potential confounding effects,
e.g., the impact of socioeconomic factors, class
environments, and differences in numbers of behavior problems. The reduced anger-in and anxiety and
increased anger control in the WLS group have the
potential to produce secondary benefit in other
realms among high school students, ranging from
decreased rates of depression and substance abuse
disorder [37] to reduced violent behavior and
improved academic performance. Another behavioral approach to stress reduction, meditation, was
associated with improved school-related behavior
and performance [38].
Essential hypertension (EH) is a clinically significant problem, particularly in the African American
population and has its origins in childhood [1].
Widespread training of WLS in adolescents may
have beneficial impact upon the incidence of EH
and related health problems. This program teaches
skills that are transferable to all domains of adolescents' lives, enhancing decision-making and coping
skills in a vulnerable population. The current
finding of a significantly larger decrease in daytime
DBP following WLS training across the 6-month
follow-up among those students with higher baseline
SBP makes a strong case for conducting a clinical
trial in a larger sample of adolescents with elevated
BP.

The findings have implications for school entities
wishing to develop prevention programs, via stress
and anger management, as well as emotional
wellness training. The present study shows that
WLS training can feasibly be delivered in the school
setting by trained school teachers. This project
developed a standardized behavior skills training
program based on facilitator training curriculum
material developed over the past decade. Materials
developed for this program can be made available
from WLS to other investigators for research
purposes. Many behavioral treatment strategies are
difficult to disseminate because of financial costs
and/or difficulties and expense in training teachers
and integrating them into large group settings such
as school systems. The present study demonstrates
that school teachers can be trained to conduct the
WLS workshop and implement the program successfully in the real-world school setting, suggesting
that the WLS program can feasibly be implemented
within school systems.
There are several significant and unique aspects of
this study, first and foremost, being the specific
behavioral stress management program selected.
The WLS program has been demonstrated to be
easily and inexpensively implemented as part of a
school health curriculum. The ninth grade curriculum in the State of Georgia mandates a study of
Health and Safety for one semester, making inclusion of the program easier to justify for approval by
the schools. A second feature of this study is the focus
on the dynamic regulation of BP rather than reliance
solely on casual BP by examining the effects of the
intervention on BP changes that occur over 24 h via
ambulatory BP monitors. Thirdly, the study extends
behavioral stress reduction to the adolescent population. The study of this group is important for at least
three reasons. (1) It provides an opportunity to
examine the effectiveness of a non-pharmacological
intervention on BP reduction prior to the potentially
confounding influences of sustained elevated BP that
adversely affects the functioning of the organ systems

later on in life [39]. (2) Epidemiological studies indicate
that BP percentile rankings for age and sex tend to
track from late childhood through adolescence into
adulthood [40
, 41]. With adolescents, it is possible to
study preventive strategies at a time when such
interventions may still be effective prior to development of pathology. (3) The prevention of EH in
pediatric patients has not been a high priority, and as
a result, little is known about the factors underlying
pediatric EH. Therefore, given that BP in our youth is
increasing at an alarming rate, the prevention of EH
and its consequences in the pediatric population
pioneered at the Georgia Prevention Institute, has
become an important area of investigation [42].
Prevention of EH prior to the onset of target organ
damage would be highly cost-effective [43].
The ultimate importance of this study lies in the
concept that a BP-reducing intervention imbedded in
the school curriculum could potentially have an
enormous impact on public health. Even a small
downward shift in the BP distribution among youth
could substantially reduce the risk of EH and related
CVD risk over the long term and thereby have a great
public health impact on the number of CHD and
stroke events prevented over time [
1
, 41
, 44]. The
findings are important in showing that prevention of
EH and subsequent CV risk in an at-risk population
has the potential to be implemented on a large scale. If
con
firmed in further trials, the reduced anger-in and
anxiety and increased anger control over the follow-up
period in students receiving WLS training could have
the added bene
fit of improved mental health and
academic performance and reduced violence.
