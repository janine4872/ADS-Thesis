ABSTRACT
The purpose of the current outcome study was to determine the impact of Student Success Skills (SSS) classroom guidance lessons on the Academic Behaviors (motivation, social engagement, self-regulation) and Key Learning Skills and Techniques associated with college-career readiness (CCR) indicators for Grade 5 students (ACT, 2008a; Brigman & Webb, 2012; Conley, 2010; Robbins, Allen, Casillas, Peterson, & Le, 2006). School counselors in the treatment schools were trained in the implementation of the SSS classroom program and subsequently taught the material to Grade 5 students. Comparison school counselors conducted business as usual. The study applied a quasi-experimental pre/post1/post2 design utilizing student self-report instruments (Student Engagement in School Success Skills Survey [SESSS], Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire [MSLQ]), and a teacher survey instrument (Student Participation Questionnaire [SPQ]).

INTRODUCTION
The importance of preparing students for successful participation in the 21stcentury economy lies in the implementation of effective college-career readiness (CCR)
interventions (Bouffard & Savitz-Romer, 2012; Carnevale, Smith & Strohl, 2010;
Conley, 2010; U.S. Department of Education [USDOE], 2010). Educational reform
includes efforts to develop and align core academic standards, PK–12, to insure rigorous
academic content as well as to meet college-career ready expectations (O’Hara, 2012;
Adams, 2012; Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS], 2012; Carnevale et al., 2010; Conley,
2005; National Office for School Counselor Advocacy [NOSCA], 2010). Discussions of
“education pipelines,” “K–12 career pathways,” and “P–20 education” (O’Hara, 2012;
College Board Advocacy & Policy Center [College Board], 2008; Conley, 2010) seek to
improve the preparation and transition of students into CCR from an early age. However,
a clear understanding of what an education pipeline looks like prior to entering high
school is needed. ACT (2008b) addressed the need to monitor the development of
“academic discipline,” recognized as essential to CCR, in students as early as upper
elementary school. Therefore, a more complete description of how elementary schoolaged students enter into a college-career trajectory and the role that elementary school
counselors play in CCR counseling is needed.
The issue of improving CCR has received attention from a variety of sources.
Researchers suggest that CCR interventions create a college-going culture in which
students develop key knowledge, skills, and attitudes, and participate in rigorous

academic content from an early age (Adams, 2012; Bouffard & Savitz-Romer, 2012;
Educational Policy Improvement Center [EPIC], 2012; Hines, Lemons, & Crews, 2011;
NOSCA, 2010). The Student Success Skills (SSS) program is a widely researched and
evidence-based program that teaches and coaches key skills (learning skills, social skills,
and self-management skills) to students (Brigman & Campbell, 2003; Brigman, Webb, &
Campbell, 2007; Villares, Frain, Brigman, Webb, & Peluso, 2012; Webb, Brigman, &
Campbell, 2005). Specific instruction in these skills via the SSS program is intended to
develop a culture of academic readiness in the elementary school setting by which
students develop a foundation of key CCR skills and techniques. The current study is
expected to establish a link between the implementation of the SSS curriculum in Grade 5
classrooms as a means to teach key learning, social, and self-management skills, thereby
producing positive academic and social outcomes and leading to an early CCR trajectory.
Significance of Problem
The current research study addresses a significant problem for three reasons.
First, failure to produce students who are college-career ready at the time graduation
results in negative academic consequences. Underprepared students may not be able to
participate in wide range of postsecondary, university, college, or training options.
According to the BLS, 21st-century graduates are more likely to be employed and will
have higher median weekly earnings based on their level of postsecondary training or
education (BLS, 2012). Failure to aspire to and complete postsecondary training or
education results in real financial impact for students. Second, remediation of core
academic subjects critical for rigorous college-level work occurs at college and university
levels. Student participation in remedial coursework is associated with a lesser degree of

academic success (Attewell, Lavin, Domina, & Levey, 2006). The cost of remedial
coursework is high, $58.8 million in the state of Florida, with students paying $113
million per year. This translates to an average tuition increase of $504 per remedial
course (Office of Program Policy Analysis & Government Accountability [OPPAGA],
2006). Third, an extensive amount of work has been done to define CCR at the high
school and middle school level (ACT, 2012a; Conley, 2010). However, the foundation of
CCR, originating at the elementary school level, is poorly defined. Addressing CCR is
important for students (K–12), education systems, and society as a means to improve
education-career-economic outcomes in the 21st century. Focusing on the role of the
elementary school counselor in initiating a college-career trajectory through the
instruction of foundational skills is essential (ACT, 2007; Heckman, 2008; NOSCA,
2010). A concrete operationalization of what a P–20 education pipeline looks like prior
to entering high school is needed. A firm foundation in key skills at an early age reduces
the need for more intense corrections later (Cunha & Heckman, 2008; Cunha, Heckman,
& Schennach, 2010; Heckman, 2008). Currently, additional outcome research is required
to directly link the elementary school counselor’s role to the development of student
outcomes specific to CCR.
Purpose
The purpose of the current outcome study is to determine the impact of SSS
classroom guidance lessons on the early Academic Behaviors (motivation, social
engagement, self-regulation) and Key Learning Skills and Techniques associated with
CCR indicators for Grade 5 students (ACT, 2008a; Conley, 2010; Robbins, Allen,
Casillas, Peterson, & Le, 2006). Research has identified essential factors for successful

CCR, including (a) cognitive strategies, learning skills and techniques, transition
knowledge and skills, and content knowledge (Conley, 2005, 2010; EPIC, 2012); (b)
motivation, social engagement, and self-regulation (ACT, 2008a; Robbins et al., 2006);
(c) noncognitive skills (Farrington et al., 2012); (d) growth mindset (Dweck & Leggett,
1988; Dweck, Walton, & Cohen, 2011); (e) social-emotional skills (Duckworth, Peterson,
Matthews, & Kelly, 2007); and (f) assets (Scales, Benson, Roehlkepartain, Sesma, & van
Dulmen, 2006; Scales & Taccogna, 2000). School counseling oriented professional
associations and advocacy groups call for a focus on CCR through established career
development standards (American School Counselor Association [ASCA], 2004;
National Career Development Association [NCDA], 2004) and systematic approaches to
CCR counseling (NOSCA, 2010). The recent revision of the ASCA Mindsets and
Behaviors for Student Success: K-12 College- and Career-Readiness Standards for Every
Student (ASCA, 2014) confirms this commitment to developing the requisite knowledge,
attitudes, and skills for student CCR. Additional research in this area has identified the
later elementary and early middle school years as the sensitive time in which to initiate
development of these factors (ACT, 2008b, 2012a, 2013; Cunha & Heckman, 2008;
Farrington et al., 2012; Heckman, 2008).
