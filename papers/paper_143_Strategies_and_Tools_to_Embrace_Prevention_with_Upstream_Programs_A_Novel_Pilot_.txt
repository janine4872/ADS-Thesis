Abstract
Social–emotional learning (SEL) programs can be considered upstream, or primary prevention, because they focus on providing students with the life skills necessary to navigate situations and relationships from which problem behaviors may arise to prevent a crisis situation. Strategies & Tools to Embrace Prevention with Upstream Programs (SEL@MS, formerly known as STEP UP) is a comprehensive SEL curriculum for middle school students aimed at promoting universal prevention strategies for healthy populations. SEL@MS enhances protective factors against negative behaviors by reinforcing multilevel approaches to strengthening community, interpersonal, and individual attributes with lesson plans that can be integrated into school curricula. This quasi-experimental pilot study was conducted over the course of two years with 59 middle school students assigned to either the intervention (n = 27) or control (n = 32) group. Analyses demonstrated significant improvements among students in the intervention group in self-regulation, responsibility, social competence, and empathy. Results of this study suggest that SEL@MS is a promising approach to enhance social and emotional protective factors that, when fostered over time, have the potential to improve overall mental health.

The period of transition from youth to adolescence (ages 10 to 13) is a critical time for physiological and psychological development to strengthen social and emotional skills and protective factors. Students entering middle school often find themselves in an unfamiliar environment, requiring them to maneuver new social circumstances while building skills for independent thought and decision making (Mullins & Irvin, 2000; Rudolph, Lambert, Clark, & Kurlakowsky, 2001). During these formative years, the school and classroom climates have the potential to be significant sources of either stress or support for youths. At this stage, education on social and emotional supports and resources may be introduced or enhanced, thereby helping youths better understand how to engage in relationships with themselves and with others (Roth, Brooks-Gunn, Murray, & Foster, 1998). One way to help ensure positive youth development is through social and emotional learning (SEL) and universal prevention programs that address individual factors and the school climate as a whole (Greenberg et al., 2003; Wells, Barlow, & Stewart-Brown, 2003).

Prevention programs have the greatest effect when they are implemented before any problems arise that may require intervention or treatment (Kessler et al., 2005). The presence of risk factors for negative social and emotional health outcomes in childhood have been shown to increase the likelihood of problem behaviors during adolescence and young adulthood (Alperstein & Raman, 2003; Webster-Stratton, Reid, & Stoolmiller, 2008). Children who are introduced to upstream, primary prevention programs early on that focus on aspects of SEL that enhance resiliency and self-regulation will be able to apply the skills learned to problem situations or negative life experiences they may encounter later in life (Gitterman, 2014; Masten & Coatsworth, 1998). Reinforcement of those lessons during adolescence will help to ensure that students are guided to evolve their SEL skills as they mature and undertake new experiences (Evans, Murphy, & Scourfield, 2015).

Current School-Based SEL Programs
Social–emotional competence and academic performance have been shown to be highly related (Zins, Elias, & Greenberg, 2003), providing encouragement for the adoption of SEL programs into schoolwide curricula. Current literature showcases numerous multicomponent SEL programs that have been shown to be effective for improving academic and behavioral outcomes in middle school students through classroom and school-based approaches, including reducing problem behaviors (Dusenbury, Weissberg, Goren, & Domitrovich, 2014; Eisen, Zellman, & Murray, 2003; Espelage, Low, Polanin, & Brown, 2013; Farrell, Meyer, & White, 2001), improved academic performance (Lemberger, Selig, Bowers, & Rogers, 2015; Nichols-Barrer & Haimson, 2013), and overall improved SEL skills and outcomes (Dusenbury et al., 2014; Eisen et al., 2003; Farrell et al., 2001; Lemberger et al., 2015). These programs use different approaches to promoting SEL such as adjusting teaching practices or the organizational policies and structures in which the program is being implemented, incorporating SEL into specific academic curricula, or explicit SEL skills instruction; they also provide strategies to introduce SEL into a variety of settings, including the classroom, school, family, or community.

In a 2012 meta-analysis reviewing the effects of school-based SEL programs, Sklad, Diekstra, Ritter, Ben, and Gravesteijn (2012) found the most beneficial effects of these types of programs to be toward academic achievement and reducing substance abuse, with moderate effects seen for social skills, antisocial behavior, positive self-image, mental health, and prosocial behavior. Incorporation of these curricula into the academic standards for preschool through high school is encouraged, emphasizing the five interconnected sets of core cognitive, affective, and behavioral competencies: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision making (Weissberg & Cascarino, 2013). A more recent meta-analysis reviewed the follow-up effects of universal SEL interventions six months or longer after the end of the program. This analysis found positive immediate post-intervention effects, regardless of students’ race, school location, or family income. Positive well-being effects attributable to participation in SEL programs were still found six to 18 months after the end of the program, and researchers noted SEL skill development that continued post-intervention as the strongest predictor of long-term well-being (Taylor, Oberle, Durlak, & Weissberg, 2017).

SEL@MS Program
Given the value of social–emotional competencies and their relationship to education and overall well-being, a new program was created to promote the understanding and regular practice of SEL competencies among students to slow or stop the development of problem behaviors and help prevent potential associated negative consequences. Strategies & Tools to Embrace Prevention with Upstream Programs (SEL@MS, formerly known as STEP UP) is a comprehensive SEL curriculum for middle school students aimed at promoting universal prevention strategies for healthy populations. SEL@MS was developed in response to the 2012 National Strategy for Youth Suicide Prevention to include upstream approaches and programs to build resilience and reduce risk in broad-based populations. The content of SEL@MS was created using a theoretical framework that integrates cognitive–behavioral theory (CBT), social learning theory (SLT), positive psychology, and the social–ecological model (SEM). CBT and SLT were used to determine the priority skills and coping strategies taught in this program and—in combination with positive psychology—help to inform the various activities and story content included in the program. SEM informs the overall framework of the program by incorporating content and activities specifically for students to learn by and about themselves (intrapersonal) and with their peers (interpersonal), for parents to understand and reinforce SEL skills at home (community), and for teachers and school administrators to encourage positive SEL strategies that will help to improve the overall school climate (societal). SEL@MS extends the benefits of the SEL elementary curriculum, Camp MakeBelieve Kids (Jones, Nash, & Nathan, 2009), to middle school students in an appealing way that is congruent with their level of development. Camp MakeBelieve Kids provides an eight-step framework that gives school districts and parents the support and tools to build social and emotional competencies in elementary students. Independent researchers analyzed outcome data for the Camp MakeBelieve Kids program, which showed positive changes in social, emotional, and behavioral outcomes among small clinical populations (Davis, 2011; Jones et al., 2009) and increases in social–emotional knowledge among a small sample of fourth-grade students (Kovacs, 2015).

SEL@MS takes concepts and strategies of previous research into account and provides lesson plans that address the common goals of all SEL programs, to help schools work toward a healthier and more inclusive school climate. The program is divided into 16 25-minute lessons that can be delivered once or twice per week. Each lesson addresses a specific SEL concept, such as self-regulation, understanding boundaries, or recognizing manipulative behaviors. Interactive activities, practice skills, and strategies included in the program incorporate a variety of cognitive–behavioral techniques, expressive art, and metacognition and mindfulness techniques that are geared toward improving emotional regulation, social competence, self-awareness, and motivation through the implementation of a generalized learning experience. All instructional blocks incorporate student journaling, and lesson activities can include individual reflection, group discussions, role playing, and self-assessments. Supplemental materials are provided for each lesson to help focus the activities on student mastery of the content within each section. Lessons include take-home memos for parents that outline the SEL instruction that was provided and how to foster those skills at home.

Using a multilevel approach, SEL@MS aims to build a healthier school climate by improving social and emotional competencies of middle school students. The SEL@MS curriculum is designed to be taught by trained teachers or school counselors who have participated in four separate training sessions of 50 minutes each. During this training, new SEL@MS instructors are provided with complete lesson plans, instructions on how to incorporate the activities, and background on SEL and suicide prevention.

Current Study
Awareness of the importance of SEL has grown in the past few decades, spurring the integration of SEL concepts and strategies into academic standards and practices (Devaney, O’Brien, Resnik, Keister, & Weissberg, 2006; Elbertson, Brackett, & Weissberg, 2009; Kress, Norris, Schoenholz, Elias, & Seigle, 2004; Weissberg, 2015). Following recommendations for future research by Durlak, Weissberg, Dymnicki, Taylor, and Schellinger (2011) to gather additional data across multiple outcome areas and assess person-centered factors that affect outcomes associated with SEL programs, the current study looked at determining the effectiveness of a universal school-based SEL program in increasing social–emotional competencies in middle school students. More specifically, the aim of the research was to determine whether the program would enhance social–emotional skills such as empathy, self-regulation, social competence, and responsibility. It was hypothesized that youths who participated in SEL@MS would report improved social–emotional skills when compared with their counterparts who did not participate in the program and that teachers would report improved social–emotional skills of the youths who participated in the program compared with those who did not. This is the first evaluation of this specific SEL program and will help to establish a foundation of evidence and context for future studies while informing improvements for future implementation of this program.

Method
Participants
A total of 64 students from an urban private school participated in the two-year program, with five students lost to attrition during that time. The average age of the students at the start of the study was 12.16 years (SD = 0.37), and there were 33 male participants (52 percent) and 31 female participants (48 percent). The majority of the students in the study were white (72.6 percent); the remaining students included Asian (9.7 percent), African American (4.8 percent), and Hispanic (3.2 percent) students. In addition, 4.8 percent self-identified as “other” and 4.8 percent preferred not to answer.

Measures
To measure changes in SEL, students and teachers in both the control and intervention groups completed pre- and post-implementation assessments. The Social Emotional Assets and Resilience Scales (SEARS) are strength-based assessments that measure positive social–emotional attributes of children and adolescents. As the main purposes of SEL@MS are to improve social–emotional competence, build protective factors, and promote positive mental health, it was important to choose assessments based on positive psychology that measure positive social–emotional behaviors rather than problem symptoms. Strength-based measures, such as SEARS, are aligned with the SEL concept to develop students’ social and emotional competencies (Romer & Merrell, 2013).

SEARS
The SEARS assessment has testing components for teachers to rate students ages five to 18 years on social and emotional attributes (SEARS-T) and also as a self-report assessment for youths ages eight to 12 (SEARS-C) and youths ages 13 to 18 (SEARS-A). Each assessment contains a set of statements that are rated 0 = never, 1 = sometimes, 2 = often, or 3 = always. The SEARS-T includes 41 items (for example, “Accepts responsibility when she/he needs to”) that are divided into the four subscales: self-regulation (13 items), social competence (12 items), empathy (six items), and responsibility (10 items). The SEARS-C includes 35 items (for example, “I am good at understanding what other people think”) and only has a total score with no subscales. The SEARS-A includes 35 items (for example, “I am good at understanding the point of view of other people”) and is divided into four subscales: self-regulation (eight items), social competence (10 items), empathy (11 items), and responsibility (six items). Each subscale is scored separately before calculating the total score. As exemplified by the sample items provided, the items in SEARS-A are similar to the items of SEARS-C, but are age appropriate. Higher scores on all assessments are indicative of higher social–emotional competence. Therefore, higher-scoring individuals are predicted to be more resilient than those with lower scores. Students with lower scores are considered to be at-risk and in need of additional support. SEARS-C assessments were used for year 1 of this study, and SEARS-A were used for year 2 to comply with the recommendation of using the measure validated for each age group.

The SEARS assessments are psychometrically sound and show adequate levels of reliability and validity (Merrell, 2011). The SEARS-T, SEARS-C, and SEARS-A assessments have moderately high statistically significant convergent validity with other tests of social–emotional competence with correlations ranging from .62 to .78 (p > .01) and have demonstrated strong temporal stability through high test–retest reliability in multiple studies: SEARS-T coefficients at .90, SEARS-C ranging from .67 to .81, and SEARS-A from .80 to .84 (Nese et al., 2012); SEARS-T coefficients at .94 for the total score and ranging from .84 to .92. for the subscales, SEARS-C ranging from .73 to .81, and SEARS-A from .78 to .89 (Romer & Merrell, 2013). Finally, all SEARS forms have strong internal consistency, with alpha values ranging from .80 to .98 (Merrell, 2011; Romer & Merrell, 2013). Internal consistency reliability based on the participants in this study was also high, with an alpha value for the initial administration of the SEARS-T of .98, and for the SEARS-C of .85. Similarly, alpha reliability coefficients for the second administration of the SEARS-T was .98 and the SEARS-A was .92.

Program Implementation
SEL@MS was implemented over a two-year period during an advisory class—a period of time set aside for teachers to work with smaller groups of students in a mentorship capacity. In the first year (2013), four seventh-grade middle school teachers from a local private school were randomly assigned to either an experimental or control condition (two in each group). Random assignment of students to classrooms was not feasible based on the standard operating procedures of the school. During the second year of the program, students moved into the eighth grade and may have been assigned to a different teacher with different classmates but remained in their respective groups—either control or experimental—which could not be avoided based on school policy. Parental consent for participation in the study was obtained for each student.

Over the two-year period, the two teachers assigned to the control group provided their students with the standard advisory period curriculum consisting of group academic coaching, team building activities, and unstructured play. The two teachers assigned to the experimental group provided the SEL@MS curriculum to their students once or twice a week for 25 minutes each during the advisory period. Each student in the experimental group received the full program twice, once each year. In the first year, the SEL@MS curriculum was implemented for eight weeks. In the second year, the SEL@MS curriculum was implemented over 12 weeks to provide some flexibility to teachers, but all students received the same amount of instruction time and the same content.

Teachers and students completed the SEARS assessments immediately before receiving the SEL@MS curriculum in 2013 and after program completion in 2014. Because of the test’s age requirement, the SEARS-C assessment was completed by the students in the first year and the SEARS-A was used for the second year. Even though the SEARS-A is recommended for students in grade 7, at the start of grade 7 most students in this study were only 12 years old, younger than the prescribed age for the grade. Therefore, SEARS-C assessments were given first based on the student’s age and not grade level to ensure that the items were age appropriate.

Intervention Fidelity
Throughout the study, research assistants trained by the program developer intermittently observed teachers in the treatment group implementing the program. The research assistants in this study were all Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative certified to conduct research and evaluation work with human subjects and had at least two years of experience conducting research for 12 to 15 hours a week in a psychology research lab. Fidelity checklists were used during observations to verify that (a) the program delivery met the objectives of the lesson, (b) the delivery of the material was at least 25 minutes in length, (c) the curriculum was delivered during the allotted time, (d) all materials were organized and were provided to all of the students, (e) all of the students were given an equal chance to participate in the curriculum activities, (f) the teacher was open to students’ ideas and addressed all of their concerns, (g) the students were given the opportunity to reflect on the current topic/assignment, and (h) the teacher provided an appropriate ending to the lesson.

Results
Data were analyzed using SPSS Version 22 (IBM Corp., 2013). Statistical significance was evaluated for the scores on each assessment using p values set at .05 for the evaluation of pretest scores, and an alpha of .01 for subsequent analysis; practical significance was evaluated for the scores on each assessment using partial eta-squared effect-size estimates.

Baseline Differences
T tests were conducted to determine preprogram differences between the experimental and the control groups on all pre-assessment scores (SEARS-C and SEARS-T) and a chi-square test was conducted to determine whether there were gender differences. No significant between-group differences were detected by gender; however, one significant difference was detected for the SEARS-T social competence subscale (see Table 1). Therefore, this variable was used as a covariate in subsequent analyses.

Treatment--Control Group Outcome Comparison
Repeated-measures t test of differences on SEARS-T demonstrated that in the treatment group, all areas of SEL significantly improved, whereas in the control group only one area, empathy, significantly improved. However, on SEARS-A, no differences were detected in either the treatment or the control group (see Table 2).

Multivariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted comparing the difference scores in outcome measures between the treatment and control groups while controlling for pretreatment difference in SEARS-T social competence subscale scores. There was a statistically significant difference between the treatment and control groups on the combined dependent variables after controlling for pretreatment difference in SEARS-T social competence subscale scores, F(1, 49) = 3.96, p < .01; Wilk’s Λ = 0.638, partial η2 = .36.

Follow-up ANCOVA indicated that the program has a statistically significant effect on all SEARS-T assessment subscales and the total scale score, but no significant effect was found for the SEARS-C and SEARS-A assessments (see Table 3). To account for multiple ANCOVAs being run, a Bonferroni correction was applied such that statistical significance was set at p < .025.

Discussion
The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the effectiveness of the SEL@MS program in improving social–emotional competencies among youths. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of SEL@MS’s potential as a means to enhance social–emotional skills in middle school youths through upstream strategies and provide tools for youths to learn prosocial attitudes and lifelong positive coping skills. Students who participated in the program during both school years were shown to have increased their social and emotional competency skills, became more aware of their own emotions, and used more positive strategies when facing adverse situations. However, these findings were isolated to the teacher’s assessment of the student’s social–emotional skills. When students assessed their own skills, no differences were detected. Whereas teachers were able to recognize significant improvements in SEL competencies in the participating students, student self-reported scores did not show statistically significant improvement over time, consistent with previous research (Achenbach, McConaughy, & Howell, 1987). Disparities between student and teacher scores may be attributed to the relatively small sample size, short-term follow-up, and natural differences between the ways students perceive themselves and teachers’ perceptions of students after limited interactions. Also, cognitive development over time may change how children and adolescents perceive themselves and rate their own behaviors (Ray et al., 2009).

Despite the small sample size, the results have moderate effect sizes for the overall model and for all of the subscales except social competence and empathy. Results from this study are consistent with other studies on SEL programs. For example, SEL has been shown to increase emotional intelligence or the ability to recognize emotions in one’s self and others, communicate emotions effectively, and use emotions to guide decisions (Bradberry & Greaves, 2009; Farrington et al., 2012). Learning these strategies has been shown to increase overall protective factors, promote positive mental health, and help mitigate negative situations (Wyman, 2014). SEL programs can be considered upstream programs, as they do not focus on crisis or problem behavior intervention, but rather on providing students with the social and emotional life skills necessary to navigate situations and relationships from which problem behaviors may arise.

Limitations
This study has promising results, but there are limitations to consider. First, this study had a small sample size and some small effect sizes. This, in addition to the lack of participant diversity, may limit the generalizability of these results to a larger, more varied population. To increase confidence in the effectiveness of the program, this study should be replicated with a larger, more diverse sample. Second, while treatment and control groups remained in their respective groups over the two-year course of program implementation, for many students the teachers changed between the two years. However, information was not available to determine the teacher assignment in year 1; therefore, an examination of teacher effects was not possible. Given that the teachers were aware of the students’ treatment condition and completed the assessments of social–emotional competence, it is possible that teachers were more attentive to these features in the students as compared with the control group.

Recommendations for Future Research
Recommendations for future research with SEL@MS include the need for a larger and more diverse student population. Implementing the program in multiple schools and in multiple locations would be helpful in addressing this concern. Also, assessments conducted immediately after program implementation do not provide adequate information to assess the long-term impacts of the program. Follow-up assessments (for example, placed at six or 12 months after program completion) would help determine the effectiveness of the program in terms of retention of the SEL competencies gained. Although future research to further validate this program is needed, this pilot study is a first step to indicate that students who participate in SEL@MS have improved their social skills, emotion management, and regulation skills, and are more capable of respecting boundaries and displaying empathy, all upstream strategies that lead to healthier individual choices and a healthier school environment.graphic
