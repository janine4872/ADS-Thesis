Abstract
Aim
It is unclear how adult mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) should be modified for youth, and at what ages programmes should be implemented for optimal impact. Recent non-replication with a 9-week programme in early adolescence suggested abbreviated programme content might be insufficient and/or that this age group are less receptive.

Method
This controlled quasi-experimental design tested a more intensive 8-week MBI (longer meditation and session duration, plus inquiry) in Year 8 (Mage = 13.47; SD = 0.35) and Year 10 (Mage = 15.47; SD = 0.40) secondary students for feasibility and acceptability (N = 143, 45.9% female).

Results
Within this format students rated the content as agreeable, and school staff deemed content developmentally appropriate, across both age bands. Efficacy was tested in a small subsample (N = 90) to provide an estimate of effect size. Linear mixed modelling demonstrated significant between-group differences in depression (Cohen's d = 0.61; 95% CI = 0.19 to 1.03) and anxiety (d = 0.52; 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.94) at 4-month follow-up, but not immediately post-intervention.

Conclusion
An MBI more closely modelled on adult curricula was acceptable to students, although session duration was harder to timetable by schools. Promising effect sizes support further investigation in a larger sample.

1 INTRODUCTION
Three mental health disorders show the greatest impact on mortality and disability in young adults: anxiety, depression and eating disorders (Whiteford et al., 2013). These conditions typically emerge in adolescence and tend to become chronic, influencing lifelong trajectories (Agras, 2001; Neil & Christensen, 2009). Universal prevention programmes in schools offer potential mental health “immunity” to the broadest reach of students (eg, Nehmy, 2010); however, no current curriculum successfully impacts all three disorders. Mindfulness is promising in this regard given it teaches skills that counteract three shared risk factors: emotional dysregulation, rumination and maladaptive perfectionism (eg, Aldao, Nolen-Hoeksema, & Schweizer, 2010; Bieling et al., 2012; Egan, Wade, & Shafran, 2011). Further, at a developmental age when prefrontal affect regulation is inconsistent (Riediger & Klipker, 2014), it has been suggested that MBIs may amplify the effectiveness of more traditional, cognitive approaches: teaching youth how to steady themselves under the influence of hot cognitions in order to apply these strategies (McKenna, 2015).

While there is robust evidence for the helpful effects of MBIs in adults across the disorders of interest (eg, Gotink et al., 2015), research in youth is a much newer field, and it remains unclear how the adult MBIs should be modified for youth, and at what age programmes should be implemented for optimal impact. There is preliminary evidence for benefits in primary school (Felver, Celis-deHoyos, Tezanos, & Singh, 2016), where programmes tend to focus more on sensory observation and games (eg, Semple, Lee, Rosa, & Miller, 2010). However, the increased cognitive capacity of adolescents (Cook-Cottone, 2017, p. 94; Williamson, Modecki, & Guerra, 2015) opens the way for MBIs that include the more conceptual mindfulness skills.

In mainstream secondary schools, only four studies have utilized rigorous testing in large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with follow-up. Raes, Griffith, Van der Gucht and Williams (2014) investigated an 8-week Belgian programme Mindfulness Training for Teens (N = 408, Mage = 15.4 years) demonstrating improvements in depression at post-intervention that persisted at 6-month follow-up (Cohen's d ≥ 0.25). Atkinson & Wade (2015) tested a three-session MBI targeting body image (N = 347, Mage = 15.7 years) finding improvements across multiple eating disorder risk factors at 6 months (d ≥ 0.47) but no impact on negative affect. Only two trials (Johnson, Burke, Brinkman & Wade, 2016, 2017) have been conducted independently of programme developers. Testing the 8-week UK programme .b Mindfulness in Schools, designed for 11 to 18 year old adolescents, no improvements were obtained at post-intervention or at 3- to12 -month follow-up across a wide range of transdiagnostic outcome measures and potential mediators (anxiety, depression, wellbeing, weight/shape concerns, self-compassion, emotional regulation, mindfulness) in a broad band of socio-economic demographics (combined N = 865). Two hypotheses have been proposed for the non-replication of improvements in depression, stress and wellbeing from an earlier large controlled trial using this curriculum (Kuyken et al., 2013; N = 522; Mage = 15.4 years). First, that the age group (Mage = 13.54 years) tested by Johnson and colleagues may have been too young for a conceptual-based MBI; second, that the programme content or format may be insufficient to gain traction in youth in real-world settings.

Traditional adult MBIs consist of eight weekly sessions (2-2.5 hours) with 40 minutes of daily home practice and a full day silent retreat. Investigative post meditation discussion (“inquiry”) is also considered an essential ingredient (Crane et al., 2017), where the facilitator repeatedly demonstrates a kind, curious and accepting way of relating to experience and to oneself (Segal, Williams, & Teasdale, 2013, p. 253). Modifications for adolescent MBIs typically include shortened session length and meditation duration together with elimination of the day-long retreat (Zoogman, Goldberg, Hoyt, & Miller, 2015), with little description found regarding the degree of inquiry. The .b Mindfulness in Schools programme, designed to be run by trained classroom teachers with session length equivalent to a single school lesson (eg, 35-60 minutes; Johnson et al., 2016, 2017), adopts the principle of caution with both length of meditations and discussion of meditation experience as a way of protecting conscript students in a classroom setting. Conversely, the Belgian Mindfulness Training for Teens school curriculum, run by an experienced external facilitator with sessions approaching adult length (100 minutes; Dewulf, 2017) retains inquiry together with longer in-class meditations, and perhaps this is necessary to foster experiential “mind-shift” that lasts. Given low rates of compliance with home practice (Johnson et al., 2016, 2017) this may also be one way to successfully increase “dose” in single module school-based MBIs. However, given the increased difficulty in accommodating longer weekly sessions in crowded school curricula, especially for older students, it is important to demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of this approach. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to test whether the Mindfulness Training for Teens curriculum, more closely modelled on adult programmes (session and meditation duration, inclusion of inquiry), was feasible to timetable in an Australian school setting, and acceptable to early- and mid-adolescent students.

A secondary aim was to measure the efficacy of the intervention on a range of psychological measures. Although a small pilot study, this allows estimation of effect size and power calculation for a later phase trial (Black et al., 2018) to test differential impact across adolescent age bands.

2 METHOD
2.1 Participants
Five coeducational secondary schools, all of whom had taken part in our previous mindfulness research, were invited to participate. Three schools declined (Figure 1 ). The two remaining schools were classified into socio-economic (SES) bands using the Index of Community Socio-Educational Advantage (ICSEA) whereby 1000 represents the mean, with a SD of 100; (Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority, 2012; see also Johnson et al., 2016). School A was classified as low SES (ICSEA 938, within one SD below the mean, public), and School B as medium SES (within one SD above the mean, private). Schools A and B each provided a pair of Year 8 (Mage = 13.47; SD = 0.35; 41.3% female) and a pair of Year 10 (Mage = 15.47; SD = 0.40; 51.7% female) classes. Previous research in early phase trials suggests 20 participants per treatment arm provides an adequate estimate of outcome effect size to inform power for later phase trials (Black et al., 2018).

2.2 Design
For schools A and B a cluster- (class based) controlled design was used. For all classes at school A, and for the pair of Year 8 classes at school B, assignment to mindfulness or control was performed using the randomization function in Excel 2010, undertaken by the principal investigator prior to any contact with participating teachers. However, for the Year 10 pair of classes at school B, group allocation was based on timetable availability, thus the overall design is considered quasi-experimental. Primary outcome measures (Fidelity/competence, acceptability and feasibility) were administered once at post-intervention, whereas psychological outcomes were administered on three occasions: 3-weeks pre-intervention, 1-week post-intervention and 4-month follow-up. Home practice measures were administered twice, at 1-week post-intervention and 4-month follow-up.

2.3 Procedure
Research approval was granted by School Principals, the South Australian Department for Education and Child Development and the Social and Behavioural Research Ethics Committee of Flinders University. A dual consent procedure was approved: opt-out for parent and student on receipt of information pack and consent form, and student assent on the day of data collection. Testing was performed in a classroom setting with the principal investigator and teacher present. It was not possible for students or the researcher to be blind to the allocated treatment group.

2.4 Intervention
Mindfulness Training for Teens (Dewulf, 2013) is an 8-week manualized programme developed for adolescents aged 13 to 18, recently translated into English (Dewulf, 2017). Lesson format is closely modelled on adult Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR; Kabat-Zinn, 1990) and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT; Segal et al., 2013), with each weekly session commencing with guided sitting or lying meditations (10-20 minutes) followed by group inquiry (discussion of experiences and facilitator guided interpretation) and interactive presentations on mindfulness concepts.

Classes were delivered in a carpeted room away from normal classrooms to create a different and special atmosphere compared to normal lessons (Bluth et al., 2016), with students seated in a circle with name-tags to improve engagement with the external facilitator. Lesson length in a previous RCT testing this curriculum (Raes et al., 2014) was 100 minutes, which we shortened to 90 minutes to suit school timetables inclusive of a 10-minute mid-lesson break. Key elements to retain in the shorter lessons were discussed with the programme developer prior to commencement. We note that resultant lesson length was still comparably longer than in the .b Mindfulness in Schools curriculum we tested previously (35-60 minutes; Johnson et al., 2016, 2017). Given the extended nature of the meditations and inquiry with a conscript young audience, we added self-care instructions in the first lesson (options to seek help if distressing emotions arose). At the start of each meditation, students were also given the option of tuning out and taking a rest, or raising their hand if they wanted to leave the room with the school counsellor who attended each session together with the class teacher. Due to a number of students with known trauma backgrounds at school A, a discussion and meditation in the final lesson on forgiveness was modified after consultation with the school counsellor, following recent recommendations by Burrows (2017). Students were given a handout each week summarizing the lesson together with instructions for formal and informal home practices, supported by a bundle of 22 meditation audiofiles that they could download. Students were encouraged to undertake this extra practice to maximize brain change but home practice was not assessable. A midweek email was sent to class teachers with an invitation to read this to students to reiterate key points and as a reminder of home practices.

All mindfulness lessons were conducted by the first author (C.J.), a mindfulness facilitator with over 10 years of personal practice, trained as an adult MBSR facilitator and with prior experience teaching mindfulness in schools. The facilitator had one Skype session with the course developer before commencing the study, and the opportunity to email questions prior to and during the course. The control groups undertook normal lessons (ie, English, Christian Studies, Health/Physical Education or extended home group). At the conclusion of the study (ie, post collection of follow-up data), students from the control group were offered a free evening mindfulness workshop at their school with parents also invited to attend.

2.5 Outcome measures
2.5.1 Feasibility
This was assessed by whether invited schools (1) could accommodate a weekly double lesson and (2) had the capacity to provide a school counsellor to attend every session along with the class teacher.

2.5.2 Course acceptability: Students
Participants in the mindfulness intervention groups undertook an anonymous survey in the last lesson of the course rating the following three questions on a 0- to10-point Likert scale with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction/likelihood: “How would you rate the course in terms of being enjoyable and interesting?”, “How much do you think you have learnt during the course?” and “In the future, how likely are you to use any of the techniques you have learnt?”. This survey also included one competence question “How would you rate the instructor?”. During sessions, students were invited to raise their hand if they needed to take a break (with the school counsellor) due to any distress during sessions. Amount of home practice was also measured as an indication of student acceptability. At post-intervention, students were asked “During the mindfulness course, how often did you practice each of the following techniques outside of lessons? Students were supplied with a range of techniques offered during the mindfulness course and asked to rate each on a 5-point scale as follows: 1 “never,” 2 “once or twice in total,” 3 “greater than twice in total but less than once a week,” 4 “once or twice each week” to 5 “three times or more each week”. At 4-month follow-up, the question was reworded “Since the mindfulness course, how often did have you used the following techniques?”

2.5.3 Course acceptability: Staff
In the last lesson, teachers and school counsellors who attended the mindfulness intervention classes were invited to complete a survey question: “Do you think this was a good age to deliver this course? Why or why not?”

2.5.4 Fidelity and competence
Audio recordings of lessons labelled by Year level and by School were randomly selected and reviewed by the programme developer, such that each of the eight lessons was reviewed once. We used a marking rubric based on the adult Mindfulness-Based Interventions Teaching Assessment Criteria (MBI-TAC, Crane et al., 2012) which assess a combination of adherence and competence across six domains. These guidelines were modified slightly to reflect the classroom environment and assess age appropriate delivery. For each lesson, a score out of six was given for each MBI-TAC domain, which were averaged into an overall score. Students were also asked to rate the instructor as part of an anonymous course acceptability survey during the last lesson.

2.6 Psychological outcome measures
2.6.1 Depression
This was measured using the Depression subscale of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-Short form (DASS-21; Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995). The 7-item depression factor shows good fit in non-clinical adolescents (Szabo, 2010; Tully, Zajac, & Venning, 2009). Each item is scored on a 4-point scale from 0 “never” to 3 “almost always,” with higher scores reflecting higher depression over the past week. Internal reliability for all measures in this study appears in Table 1.

2.6.2 Anxiety
The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) has demonstrated good psychometric properties (Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, & Löwe, 2006) and is recommended for use from age 12 (Quittner et al., 2014). Items are scored on a 4-point scale from 0 “not at all” to 3 “nearly every day,” with higher scores reflecting higher anxiety over the past fortnight.

2.6.3 Weight and shape concerns
The weight and shape subscales of the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q; Fairburn & Beglin, 1994), were used, which correlate well with the interview format which itself has excellent psychometric properties (Berg, Peterson, Frazier, & Crow, 2012), and these subscales have been used in early adolescent research (Wilksch & Wade, 2009). These 12 items use a 7-point rating scale ranging from 0 “not at all” to 6 “markedly.” Questions relate to the last 28 days and higher scores indicate greater concerns.

2.6.4 Wellbeing
We used the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), which has been validated in both university student and community adult populations (Tennant et al., 2007) and used in adolescent samples (Kuyken et al., 2013). This 14-item scale surveys the last 2 weeks; items are rated on a 5-point scale from 1 “none of the time” to 5 “all of the time,” with higher scores signifying higher wellbeing.

2.7 Statistical analysis
All analyses were performed using IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, Version 22 (IBM SPSS). Data were assessed for normality, and logistic regression analyses conducted for the post-intervention and 4-month follow-up data to test if any baseline outcome variable predicted absence. Repeated measures analyses were then conducted using Linear mixed modelling (LMM), enabling inclusion of cases with missing data via maximum likelihood estimation. Baseline measures were entered as covariates, followed by year level as a moderator.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Feasibility
Figure 1 shows the flow of participants (schools and students) through the study. Three of five schools declined to participate, with one of these due to difficulty accommodating the double lessons given the short lead-in time-frame of the study (3 months). It was more difficult (but ultimately possible) to timetable a longer lesson, especially with the Year 10 classes, at both participating schools. Both were able to provide a school counsellor to attend sessions.

Due to a changeover of semester timetables, where students were no longer in the same class for lessons, only 22.6% of students from school A attended post-intervention data collection. This issue relates to logistical problems of conducting school-based research as opposed to the feasibility of schools accommodating the curriculum. However, data from this school could not be considered missing at random, thus only the sample from school B (N = 90) was included in psychological outcome analysis, and in some of the acceptability measures (as marked). Mean age of the school B subsample was 14.28 (SD = 1.08; range = 12.86-16.11; 52.2% female). For the Year 8 subgroup, the breakdown was as follows: Mage = 13.39; SD = 0.34; 51.0% female, and for Year 10 students: Mage = 15.45; SD = 0.37; 53.8% female.

3.2 Course acceptability: Students
At school A, one Year 10 student, identified by his classroom teacher with pre-existing emotional difficulties, was offered a choice whether to attend and discontinued after the first session. Three Year 10 students reported anxiety or embarrassment at closing their eyes during practices to their teacher. At school B, three Year 10 students opted out at T1, citing concern over missing an English lesson despite the offer of make-up classes. One Year 10 student left a session with the school counsellor after discussions on emotions and forgiveness raised her distress levels. She chose to continue attending mindfulness lessons as well as meeting with the counsellor individually.

Of the 33 students (80.4%) at school B who returned feedback forms in the last lesson, mean ratings of the course were as follows: enjoyment and interest 6.92 (median = 7; range = 3-10), amount learnt 6.88 (median = 7; range = 4-10), and likelihood of using techniques in the future 6.59 (median = 7; range = 3-9) comparable to those reported in similar universal trials of mindfulness in secondary schools (Johnson et al., 2016, 2017; Kuyken et al., 2013). T-tests showed no differences in these scores between Year 8 and Year 10 (enjoyment/interest, t(31) = 0.04, P = 0.97; amount learnt, t(31) = −0.07, P = 0.94; likely future use t(31) = 0.36, P = 0.72).

At post-intervention (school B), only 27.1% of students undertook home practice once a week or more. At four-month follow-up, numbers of students undertaking home practice once a week or more were very low (≤ 8.0%). These figures are comparable to our previous trials with the .b Mindfulness in Schools curriculum (Johnson et al., 2016, 2017). Mean levels of home practice did not differ across Year level during the course t(30) = −0.15, P = 0.88) or at follow-up (t(31) = 0.52, P = 0.61).

3.3 Course acceptability: Staff
Classroom teachers and school counsellors (N = 7, schools A and B) reported both year levels as appropriate for this curriculum All three staff in the Year 8 groups believed their students were capable of understanding the ideas and practices, and one Year 8 teacher (School A) felt it was an age where boys especially needed to develop some behavioural regulation strategies. Another Year 8 teacher (School B) felt that splitting the extended lesson into two shorter lessons per week would help reinforce learning; however, she reported improved focus and behaviour in the class with the current format. Similarly, all three staff involved with Year 10 classes across schools A and B described this as a good age, with students a bit more mature, able to think in abstract terms and sustain attention, and with more motivation due to increasing social and academic stressors. The only staff member (counsellor at school A) who attended lessons for both Year levels noted higher resistance from Year 10s.

3.4 Fidelity and competence
With one audio recording selected for each lesson by the curriculum developer, average lesson rating was in the “proficient” band (5.2/6, range = 4.7-5.5). A comment was given that meditations were sometimes shorter with less silence than in the original programme. For school B, of the 33 students (80.4%) who returned feedback forms in the last lesson, mean student ratings for the instructor were 8.9 (median = 9; range = 7-10). There were no differences in mean scores between Year 8 and Year 10 students (t(31) = 0.73, P = 0.47).

3.5 Psychological outcomes
Descriptive statistics for school B (N = 90) are shown in Table 1 . Data for depression, anxiety, and weight/shape concerns were positively skewed and transformed to achieve acceptable parameters for normality. Failure to complete post-intervention or follow-up assessment at school B was not associated to any of our outcome variables at baseline.

Repeated measures results using LMMs analyses appear in Table 2. Controlling for baseline, there were no significant between-group differences in outcome measures at post-intervention, although depression approached significance (d = 0.36). However, at 4-month follow-up, there were moderate improvements in depression (d = 0.61) and anxiety (d = 0.52). Moderator analyses by year level are shown in Table 3. Only the older age group (Year 10) showed significant improvement compared to the control group, with large between-group effect sizes at 4-month follow-up for depression (DASS-21, d = 0.95) and anxiety (GAD-7, d = 0.81). These results should be interpreted with caution, given the small sample size.

4 DISCUSSION
This study tested a more intensive 8-week mindfulness programme closely modelled on adult MBI format (length of sessions and meditations, use of inquiry) for feasibility and acceptability across two adolescent age bands (Year 8 and 10) in Australian secondary schools. The longer lessons were harder to accommodate within timetables compared to a single lesson weekly format, and more so as age increased. Across both year levels, lesson content was rated as agreeable to students, and deemed age appropriate by attending school staff, although more resistance was observed for Year 10 students. There were no differences in the low homework participation rates between Year 8 and Year 10 students, which were comparable to earlier research in Australian secondary school settings (Johnson et al., 2016, 2017).

Within a format where (1) classroom teacher and school counsellor were present, (2) students had the option of tuning out or leaving the session if they felt overwhelmed, and (3) students were reminded about support options outside of the sessions, there were no reported significant adverse effects despite longer meditations and more inquiry. Student feedback regarding discomfort with closing their eyes in this setting suggests that the choice to leave eyes open should be more strongly emphasized. Students had the opportunity to “dip in and out” as they felt comfortable on a session by session basis. This multi-layered, safety net approach offers a feasible method of “going deeper” to potentially gain greater psychological shift within a conscript classroom, even where students with trauma backgrounds may be present.

A secondary aim was to gain an indication of the efficacy of the intervention within this small pilot sample. For the repeated measures analysis, there were no differences between the mindfulness and control groups for any of our outcome variables at post-intervention, but by 4-month follow-up there were moderate improvements in depression and anxiety. From the preliminary moderator analyses it is conceivable that conceptual-based mindfulness programmes gain more traction in mid- compared to early-adolescents, but we note that our sample was small and that confidence intervals are wide, so these results should be interpreted with caution. However, given the effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.5-0.95) were larger than anticipated in a universal non-clinical trial (eg, Hedges g = 0.20; Zoogman et al., 2015), further investigation of this more intensive curriculum in larger samples is warranted.

With a curriculum that requires more facilitator experience to guide post meditative inquiry, issues regarding scalability of the intervention must be considered. However, the rapidly expanding dissemination in youth of current MBIs that “may be effective” (Semple & Burke, 2019) is also problematic. If we can find robust ways to universally and effectively embed strategies in young people addressing transdiagnostic risk, this remains a worthy pursuit that may justify extra training for core staff or external facilitators. Further, programmes requiring skilled facilitation on a conceptual level may complement and amplify the effects of simpler programs delivered earlier in the developmental trajectory.

The primary limitation of this preliminary study is the small sample size for quantitative analyses of psychological outcomes, further reduced (together with generalisability) by sampling difficulties in the second school; these results should therefore only be considered as preliminary indicators of effect size requiring more data to substantiate suggested patterns. Also, given that students were not specifically asked regarding adverse events (or whether they tuned out during sessions) our results may not be a true indication of their frequency. However, our “universal precaution” approach supported individual student choice and anonymity in participation or non-participation in practices. Due to the small nature of the research team, it was not possible to undertake analysis of outcome data blind to treatment group allocation, but given that this data was self-report rather than clinician-rated, the risk of detection bias is lessened.

5 CONCLUSION
A mindfulness programme closely modelled on adult MBI format in terms of content and session duration was feasible acceptable in a pilot study across early- and mid-adolescent age bands in two Australian secondary schools. Increased difficulty with timetabling longer lessons was countered by promising effect size estimates in depression and anxiety. Further research is warranted in larger samples.
