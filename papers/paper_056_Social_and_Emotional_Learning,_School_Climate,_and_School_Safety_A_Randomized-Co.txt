Teachers and administrators across the United States struggle to maintain safe, civil, community- and achievement-oriented schools. During the 2014–15 school year alone, 12-to-18-yearold students experienced more than 1.4 million nonfatal victimizations (e.g., violence, theft) at
school (U.S. Department of Education, 2019). School leaders, however, have no whole-school,
empirically tested “best” or “promising” practices to address these safety concerns. One proposed strategy for promoting holistic improvements in school climate and safety is improving
the social and emotional skills of students and educators.
This report summarizes results from a project funded by the National Institute of Justice in 2015 to study the association between social and emotional learning (SEL) and school
climate and school safety in which RAND partnered with the Jackson (Mississippi) Public
School District (JPSD). JPSD implemented Tools for Life®: Relationship-Building Solutions
(hereafter referred to as Tools for Life or TFL), a classroom- and home-based program for
children age three through five and grades 1 through 8 designed to improve school climate
and safety through the proactive development of students’ interpersonal skills (relationshipbuilding and communication) and intrapersonal skills (self-regulation and resiliency). For this
study, JPSD implemented TFL in grades 1 through 8 in the 2016–2017 and 2017–2018 school
years. RAND researchers conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine whether TFL,
integrated into existing school practices, positively affected school climate and safety in the
district.
TFL consists of a toolkit for teachers, which includes supporting materials to send home
for students’ parents/guardians and a classroom library of fiction and nonfiction texts used
in each TFL lesson, and a toolkit for home (HomeSTART), which incorporates the same
lesson materials as the classroom toolkit. Each grade level has from eight to ten lessons, which
focus on a specific skill and use inquiry-based learning1 and pedagogical approaches. The
calm-down corner was a very visible and prominent way in which each classroom teacher was
expected to implement TFL. All teachers were required to establish a calm-down corner in
their classroom, an area where students could visit when necessary to check their emotions and
calm down before returning to class.
Objectives of This Study
This study had three objectives:
1. Describe the implementation of TFL in JPSD.
2. Assess the degree to which TFL is effective in improving school climate and school
safety outcomes.
3. Measure the costs of implementing TFL in JPSD.
To meet these objectives, we conducted a cluster randomized trial for students in grades 3
through 8 attending traditional public elementary and middle schools in JPSD. Twenty-three
schools were randomly assigned to implement TFL in academic year 2016–2017 (treatment
schools), and 22 schools were randomly assigned to continue to conduct business-as-usual
and to delay implementation of TFL until academic year 2017–2018 (control schools). We
requested active consent from students’ parents/guardians to conduct the research required in
this study. Less than one-third of the eligible students in the district opted to participate in
data collection. The remaining students either did not return consent forms or returned consent forms indicating that their parents/guardians did not wish to have their children participate in data-collection activities. We address the implications of this low response rate in the
main body of this report.
To provide a descriptive portrait of the implementation of TFL in JPSD in the 2016–2017
and 2017–2018 academic school years, we relied on data from interviews with JPSD district
and Mississippi Department of Education (MDE) officials, district-level TFL implementers,
and Tools for Life Corporation coaches; results from surveys administered to students in grades
3 through 8; and interviews with school leaders and focus groups with instructional staff collected from six purposefully selected treatment and control schools. To assess the impact of
TFL on school and students’ outcomes across both years of the study, we used data from the
student surveys and JPSD administrative data. We also documented the costs of TFL in JPSD,
relying on JPSD administrative data and financial records from TFL and JPSD.
Analytic Approach
The theory of change illustrated in Figure S.1 served as the study’s framework for analysis. This
theory of change posits that TFL inputs and activities (school staff training provided by TFL,
classroom toolkits with complementary practices for home) and outputs (the implementation
of TFL) will increase short-term outcomes (school staff and students’ knowledge and skills).
School staff will develop an in-depth comprehension of TFL techniques, and students will
increase their intrapersonal (identify and recognize feelings, express feelings) and interpersonal
skills (communicate respectfully, solve relationship problems, resolve conflicts). All members
of the school community will start using a common language vis-à-vis relationship-building.
With increases in TFL-related school staff and student knowledge and skills, we hypothesize
that mediating factors (staff and student attitudes and students’ socioemotional health, such
as self-regulation and empathy) will change. Ultimately, short-term outcomes and mediating
factors produce positive longer-term outcomes: increased perceptions of school safety among
students and staff; stronger perceived bonds and improved school climate; increases in teacher
Summary xi
and student attendance; increases in school safety as measured by observations of student and
staff behavior and reduction in rates of office disciplinary referrals, out-of-school suspensions,
and reported injury and aggressive incidents. Though not a primary outcome of interest, we
also investigated the effect of TFL on student achievement (as measured through results on
Mississippi state assessments) as a secondary, exploratory analysis. We hypothesized that with
a greater sense of community and connection among students and teachers, students would
become more engaged in instruction, leading to gains in achievement. Decades of research
have demonstrated that when students are more engaged in instruction they tend to have
higher academic achievement (Fredericks et al., 2004).
Research Questions and Data Sources
The study had two stages. In the first stage, we examined the impacts of TFL after one academic year of exposure. In the second stage, we examined the impacts of TFL exposure on students’ developmental trajectories. Our analyses in this report provide a descriptive portrait of
the implementation of TFL in JPSD in the 2016–2017 and 2017–2018 academic school years.
We used data from key stakeholder interviews, results from surveys administered to students
in grades 3 through 8, and data from interviews with key TFL implementers and school leaders as well as focus groups with instructional staff collected from six focal schools. We assessed
the impact of TFL on school and students’ outcomes across both years of the study, using data

from the student surveys and JPSD administrative data. We also documented the costs of TFL
in JPSD relying on JPSD administrative data and financial records from TFL and JPSD.
We used a mixed-method approach that drew on both quantitative and qualitative data
to describe the implementation, assess the potential impact, and document the costs of the
TFL program. We asked seven research questions, listed in Table S.1. A description of the data
sources are available in this report’s technical appendix (available at www.rand.org/t/RR4285).
Key Findings
TFL Had Little Impact on Students’ Social and Emotional Learning, Behavior, or Academic
Performance
In analyzing JPSD administrative records and student survey responses, we found that after
one year of implementation of TFL, there were no practically or statistically significant differences between schools that implemented TFL (treatment schools) and those that did not
(control schools) in measures of students’ social and emotional, school climate, behavioral, or
achievement outcomes. We also conducted exploratory examinations of differences in outcomes among subgroup populations, specifically comparing middle school with elementary
school students and students who were homeless with those who were not. We did not find
any discernible differences across subgroups. We conducted exploratory analyses of the impact
of full TFL exposure on student outcomes. We did find a positive association between students’ self-reported exposure to TFL materials and lessons and their self-reported social and
emotional outcomes.
Key Stakeholders Reported Positive and Negative Views About TFL Implementation
Interviews with JPSD implementation coaches (district staff who were to support TFL implementation) and TFL consultants, and interviews with school leaders and focus groups with
instructional staff in the six focal schools, revealed varied perspectives about TFL. Teachers
with whom we spoke noted that materials and resources were reportedly easy to use, yet they

also noted that materials and resources were not age-appropriate (they seemed too young or
basic) for middle schoolers. Interviewees and focus group participants also noted that dosage
was low: School administrators and instructional staff wore lanyards with the basic concepts
of TFL on them, hung posters about feelings in classroom and school hallway walls, and created calm-down corners in classrooms so that students had quiet places to go to if they felt they
needed to, but the ongoing instruction about TFL concepts was left to guidance counselors (in
elementary schools) and to social studies teachers (in middle schools). Moreover, focus group
participants noted that the TFL lessons were reportedly not clear; staff had little idea about
how exactly to implement the lessons, if they had chosen to make time to do so.
Implementation of TFL Was Uneven Across Schools and, in Many Cases,
Reportedly Shallow
Interviews with JPSD implementation coaches (district staff who were to support TFL implementation) and with TFL consultants revealed that implementation of TFL varied across
schools in both years of the study. Interviewees also reported that this variation occurred
even in the second year for treatment schools, as well as across the control schools, which
implemented TFL in 2017–2018 only. Student surveys indicated that exposure to various TFL
materials and lessons varied widely across treatment schools, and also between treatment and
control schools (in year 1). Our analysis in six focal schools corroborated the students’ survey
results: Interviews and focus group discussions with school staff and leaders in each school
reported different ways in which TFL materials and structure were provided to students. TFL
was rarely, if at all, implemented across a whole school as it was designed. Thus, implementation of TFL in JPSD over the first two years remained shallow.
A Variety of Factors Facilitated and Impeded Implementation
Interviews with key stakeholders and the analysis in six focal schools unveiled factors that
could have affected the implementation of TFL and led to the reported uneven implementation across schools and varied exposure of TFL concepts to students. These factors included
attitudes, district-level structures, and broader contextual factors:
• Attitudes: The extent to which parents, teachers, and especially school leadership had
bought-in to the positive-behavior concepts promoted by TFL stakeholders’ desire for a
positive behavior approach.
• District-level structure: Respondents reported that JPSD and TFL support facilitated
implementation for them. However, they also noted situations in which communication
lines faltered and that there were few opportunities for collaboration. Parental engagement was minimal, and in those schools that experienced principal turnover there was a
lack of clear leader advocacy or attention to the program.
• Contextual factors: MDE audited JPSD concurrently with implementation of TFL in
2016–2017, which reportedly distracted many educators from implementing TFL. Moreover, teachers and school leaders were reportedly “burned-out” on having to implement
new programs that they perceived might not last in the district beyond the one year.
TFL Was Relatively Expensive to Implement
In our cost analysis, we found that TFL, as implemented in JPSD, cost approximately
$2,797,728 over the course of the 2016–2017 and 2017–2018 school years. Breaking this figure
xiv Social and Emotional Learning, School Climate, and School Safety: An Evaluation of Tools for Life®
down by year and by student, we calculate a participant cost of $174.31 per year, per student.
We conducted sensitivity analyses in which we included alternative sets of assumptions, such
as opportunity costs for teacher time for program implementation and attendance at events.
These sensitivity checks increased the costs to as much as $177.79 per student, per year, bringing the total potential annual cost to $352.10 per student.
Although there are only a few examples of cost analysis of whole-school interventions
that focus on improving school culture and student behavior from which we may draw comparisons, TFL appears to be relatively expensive compared with programs studied in other
cost analyses. In particular, Blonigen et al. (2008) found that a schoolwide positive behavioral
support program would cost approximately between $17,732 and $20,705 per school. If we
take the average school in JPSD, which as of 2017 has 235 students, the average per-school,
per-year cost of TFL implementation comes out to be $40,962.85. Furthermore, if we include
the results of our sensitivity analyses by including in-kind opportunity cost of teachers’ time
commitment, that per-school, per-year cost increases to $82,743.50.
Implications
Although the results from the outcomes analysis suggest that the offer of TFL was generally not associated with better outcomes, and thus that TFL might not have been effective or
aligned with the specific needs of JPSD school population, it is clear from the documentation
on implementation struggles and facilitators that there are several other plausible explanations
for these findings that merit consideration.
First, TFL was not the only program implemented in JPSD that was designed to improve
student SEL and school climate. For example, the district was also implementing other programs, including a Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) program. To the
extent that the benefits of participating in programs such as the PBIS program benefited all
students in the district, the estimated effects from this study represent only the additional
impact of the TFL program. This additional impact is likely to be smaller than would be
anticipated had the control condition been defined so that students in control schools received
no additional SEL programming.
Second, issues of implementation may have compromised the potential of the program
to help students. We found some evidence that implementation of TFL was not optimal: It
varied across schools and was, at best, shallow. This is evident from both the data from focal
schools and from the heterogeneity in program exposure (presented in Chapter Three)—there
were students enrolled in schools that were implementing TFL programming in year 1 who
reported low exposure to posters and lessons. Educators’ contextualized critique of the program and reasons for not fully buying into it, described in Chapter Three, may provide further
insight into the lack of detected effect in the outcomes. Moreover, at the time of TFL implementation, JPSD was dealing with superintendent turnover, the dissolution of its school board,
and MDE’s audit of its performance. These stressors reverberated among the stakeholders with
whom we spoke and most likely affected educators’ capacity to implement TFL as it was originally designed.
Finally, there are some methodological issues to consider. First, a large number of parents and guardians in JPSD did not consent to have their children participate in the study,
and it is unclear whether the students who did consent were the students who would benefit
Summary xv
most from participating in the program. It is unclear whether the program would be more
effective for these students and to what extent that would influence the overall estimation of
program impacts. Second, the SEL and school climate outcomes rely on student-self report.
There is some evidence that self-report measures of SEL and school climate may be biased. In
particular, acquiescence bias, whereby respondents have a tendency to agree with all items, and
halo effects, whereby positive perceptions about one domain influence perceptions of other
domains, pose a particular threat to validity with such measures. This is also the case for all
interview and focus group data, as those are self-reports. It is therefore possible that participants provided socially desirable responses about their perceptions of school safety and climate
or about TFL implementation. It is also plausible that, as students participated in the program,
their awareness of their own social and emotional competencies changed and they became less
lenient in their judgments about their social and emotional competencies. This could even
potentially explain the finding that self-reported self-awareness, social awareness, and selfmanagement trajectories were negatively affected through TFL participation.
It is impossible to discern exactly which factor produced the results of this study, suggesting that additional research is needed to better understand the extent to which the findings
reported here are driven by limitations of the data and sample, implementation challenges, or
other factors.

Study Objectives
At the time of this project, no SEL programs had been implemented districtwide in JPSD to
improve school climate and safety. Moreover, although TFL has been adopted in more than
100 schools in North America, no empirical analysis had yet been undertaken to rigorously
test TFL’s potential effect on school climate and safety, nor had studies of TFL rigorously
examined implementation to document the mechanism through which TFL affects the school
environment and youth outcomes. This project provided the opportunity to do so. The purpose of this project was to implement TFL across a school district and use a randomized controlled trial to determine whether TFL, integrated into existing school practice with fidelity,
can positively affect school climate and safety. This study had three objectives:
1. Describe the implementation of TFL in JPSD.
2. Assess the degree to which TFL is effective in improving school climate and school
safety outcomes.
3. Measure the costs of implementing TFL in JPSD.
Analytic Approach
The theory of change illustrated in Figure 1.1 served as the study’s framework for analysis. This
theory of change posits that TFL inputs and activities (school staff training provided by TFL;
classroom toolkits with complementary practices for home) and outputs (the implementation
of TFL) will increase short-term outcomes (school staff and students’ knowledge and skills).
School staff will develop an in-depth comprehension of TFL techniques, and students will
increase their intrapersonal (identify and recognize feelings; express feelings) and interpersonal
skills (communicate respectfully, solve relationship problems, resolve conflicts). All members
of the school community will start using a common language vis-à-vis relationship-building.
With increases in TFL-related school staff and student knowledge and skills, we hypothesize
that mediating factors (staff and student attitudes and students’ socioemotional health, such
as self-regulation and empathy) will change. Ultimately, short-term outcomes and mediating
factors produce positive longer-term outcomes: increased perceptions of school safety among
students and staff; stronger perceived bonds and improved school climate; increases in teacher
and student attendance; and increases in school safety, as measured by observations of student
and staff behavior, reduction in rates of office disciplinary referrals, out-of-school suspensions,
and reported injury and aggressive incidents.
Though not a primary outcome of interest, we also investigated the effect of TFL on student achievement (as measured through results on Mississippi state assessments) as a secondary, exploratory, analysis. We hypothesized that with a greater sense of community and connection among student and teachers, students will be more engaged in instruction, leading to
subsequent gains in achievement. Decades of research have demonstrated that when students
are more engaged in instruction they tend to have higher academic achievement (Fredericks,
Blumenfeld, and Paris, 2004).

Research Questions and Data Sources
We used a mixed-method approach that drew on both quantitative and qualitative data to
describe the implementation, assess the potential impact, and document the costs of the TFL
program. We asked seven research questions, listed in Table 1.3.
This study took place over two academic years (2016–2017 and 2017–2018). In the first
year of implementation, 45 schools were randomly assigned to treatment and control conditions. We first stratified the participating sample into elementary schools and middle schools.
Then, the stratified schools were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. Beginning in October 2016, treatment schools began implementing TFL programming in grades 4
through 8. After the first year (2016–2017), the 22 schools in the control group implemented
TFL. Details of the randomization process, including the number of schools and students allocated to the intervention and control groups, participation rates, and the characteristics of the
schools that participated in the study, are available in Appendix A.
Of the 2,941 students whose parents or guardians consented that they could participate
in data-collection activities associated with the study, 2,740 were enrolled in schools that were
randomly assigned to treatment or control conditions. 1,422 were enrolled in treatment schools
at the start of the study, and 1,318 were enrolled in control schools at the start of the study.
Before conducting any analyses, we examined the extent to which the study sample was balanced (i.e., had similar background characteristics across intervention and control conditions)
and representative (i.e., those who consented to participate in data collection had similar backFigure 1.1

ground characteristics as those who did not). We found that, though the sample was balanced
and there were no significant differences in the characteristics of students in the experiment by
treatment group, the sample was not representative: Students whose parents or guardians did
not consent to data-collection activities tended to have lower achievement and were also more
likely to have discipline issues and higher absenteeism. Complete details of the representativeness and balance of these samples is available in Appendix A.
To evaluate the impact of TFL, we conducted a cluster-randomized trial in two stages.
Stage I examined impacts after one academic year of exposure to TFL. Stage II examined trajectories for students’ outcomes from over the course of two academic years using a two-phase
multiple baseline design, which is a within-person repeated-measures design that can be used
to appraise the extent to which an intervention alters growth trajectories (Shadish, Kyse, and
Rindskopf, 2013). In the focus groups, we allowed for open discussion among participants.
To document the implementation of TFL, we relied on data from interviews with key JPSD,
MDE, and TFL staff; analysis of the student survey; and data from the study of three treatment and three control schools, which involved focus groups with school instructional staff
and interviews with school leaders.
Interviews with Key Jackson Public School District, Tools for Life, and Mississippi
Department of Education Officials
We conducted in-person and phone interviews with personnel in JPSD, TFL, and MDE in
two data collection windows (spring 2017 and spring 2018). We spoke with all personnel who
were involved in the direct implementation of TFL at the district level. This included the one
JPSD TFL lead and six TFL implementation coaches. We also spoke to the three consultants
from Tools for Life Corporation who were embedded in the schools to offer supports and guidance to school leaders and instructional staff. We purposefully selected JPSD central office
staff from the superintendent’s office and those who were in charge of guidance counseling and
curriculum standards to gain insights on the vision of TFL and how TFL could be integrated
into broader district processes and practices. We purposefully selected the one JPSD school
board member who had recently started their term to gain insights on their role, expectations

for the district, and for TFL. We purposefully selected officials from MDE who could provide
a deeper understanding of the relationship between the state and district.
Table 1.4 lists which stakeholder we interviewed in which window.
Interview protocols sought to obtain data on the implementation of TFL to document its
design features and to provide context for explaining any outcomes. We used semistructured
interviews that included open-ended questions with supplemental probes to examine specific
topics. The protocols differed for each type of interviewee and were modified in each data collection window in order to inquire about changes to the program or implementation through
time.
Protocols are available in Appendix D.
Study of Six Focal Schools
In spring 2017, fall 2017, and spring 2018, we conducted site visits at six elementary and middle
schools (three treatment and three control schools), conducting interviews with school administrators, focus groups with instructional staff members. Appendix C summarizes the data
collection and analysis for the study of the six focal schools in order to gain insights in how
TFL was implemented from educators’ perspectives. Appendix D provides interview and focus
group protocols.
Interviews. Each site visit consisted of a 45–60-minute semistructured interview with
a school leader/administrator (i.e., principal or assistant principal) and 45–60-minute interviews with designated lead TFL implementers or their counterparts in control schools (i.e.,
elementary school counselors and middle school social studies teachers). Protocols addressed
such topics as perceptions of school climate and students’ SEL needs, response to the program, and facilitators and challenges to implementation.
Focus groups. Each site visit also included a 60-minute focus group with about six to ten
staff members. We held focus groups with elementary staff after school; at middle schools, we
held focus groups during the school day and selected among staff that had planning periods
during the chosen time. Prior to the start of each focus group, we assigned participants numTable 1.4

bers for identification purposes to ensure confidentiality of participants in our notes. Protocols addressed similar topics as the interviews.
Observations of Districtwide TFL Events
We observed and took field notes during training sessions for school leaders and/or staff, yearend conferences jointly held by JPSD and Tools for Life Corporation, and bring-and-brag
sessions at which designees from implementing schools across the district (not just the focal
schools) shared examples of how they integrated the program into their schools and classrooms.
Student Surveys
To inform the implementation and outcomes analyses, we fielded online surveys to students in
grades 3 through 8. Questions on the survey inquired about students’ self-assessments of their
interpersonal and intrapersonal relationships and about the school’s climate.3
Content. The student survey was adapted from several existing instruments, including the Alaska School Climate and Connectedness Survey (American Institutes for Research,
2016), the 5Essentials My Voice, My School Survey (Bryk et al., 2010), and the Social Skills
Improvement System (SSIS) Student Form (Gresham and Elliott, 2008). Intact scales were
taken from each source, and scores were computed for each student (or school) based on these
scales. Internal consistency estimates from the baseline survey administrations are reported
in Table 1.5, as are estimates of the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), which describe
the extent to which survey constructs varied across schools. Most of the internal consistency
estimates for the student level constructs are above 0.70 and show adequate reliability. For the
school level constructs, the ICCs imply that the school-mean scale scores were also mostly reliable, with average school-mean reliabilities between 0.38 and 0.88. The Safety scale had the
lowest school-level reliability. Because these constructs were considered central to TFL’s theory
of action, we included all these scales in our analyses. Also included in the survey was a set of
items related to TFL programming. These items asked students whether they had seen TFL
materials in their schools and whether they had participated in any lessons related to these

Administration. Surveys were administered before and after the implementation of
TFL, in fall 2016, spring 2017, fall 2017, and spring 2018. Student surveys were administered to students whose parents actively consented that they could participate, using an online
survey platform in treatment and control schools. Just prior to each administration, principals
received emails with specific instructions for administering surveys. Follow-ups with coordinators were made to check on data collection progress and respond to any challenges. Additional
phone calls, emails, and, in a few instances, on-site assistance were provided to coordinators
and teachers as necessary to ensure that these data were collected in a timely manner and for
as many of the targeted students as possible.
Jackson Public School District Administrative Data
JPSD provided RAND with de-identified administrative data for all students whose parents or
guardians had consented to their participation. These data included demographic information
3 The original research plan was designed to include surveys of students and instructional staff. However, the initial fielding
of the staff survey in fall 2016 showed very low staff participation, even with multiple follow-ups and reminders. Response
rates averaged around 16 percent per school for these surveys. Thus, after the first administration, the data collection plan
was revised to focus energy and resources on maximizing student participation in the surveys.

(race/ethnicity and gender) and indicators of suspension, attendance, and annual performance
on the Mississippi Academic Assessment Program (MAAP) tests in English language arts and
mathematics. MAAP scores are not vertically scaled. For the purposes of this analysis, all test
score data were standardized within grade level based on state means and standard deviations.
We obtained administrative data from JPSD for both years of the study (2016–2017 and 2017–
2018). The complete list of administrative data is in Table 1.6.
