Evaluating the Efficacy of the Mosaic SEL Turbo
Leader Course in a Quasi-Experimental Study
Kate E. Walton, PhD, and Alea Thompson, MEd, PhD candidate
The Mosaic SEL Turbo Leader program is part of ACT’s social and emotional (SE)
learning curriculum. It is designed for middle school students and includes 17 webbased lessons covering student self-efficacy and agency, positive peer and adult
relationships and conflict strategies, and growth mindset skills and tools (for more
information on Turbo Leader, see Mawi Learning, 2020). As with any learning product,
it is important to evaluate the efficacy of Turbo Leader; that is, it is important to evaluate
the degree to which evidence supports the claim that Turbo Leader serves to improve
students’ SE skills (Mattern, 2019). This was our intent with the current study.
Key Finding
Overall, we found that students who engaged in the Mosaic SEL Turbo Leader
curriculum saw significant growth in growth mindset and self-efficacy, two skills that are
aligned with CASEL’s self-awareness competency.
Method
Students in a suburban Illinois middle school took part in the study. A quasi-experimental
design was used where students were divided into two groups, one serving as the
experimental group and one as the control group, based on their teachers. There were
420 students in grades 6–8 in the control group and 329 students in grades 6–8 in
the experimental group. Both groups of students took a 27-item survey, specifically,
Panorama Education’s Social Emotional Learning survey (Panorama Education, 2016),
in September and the same survey again in January. Five SE skills, which align to
CASEL’s competencies, were assessed including grit, growth mindset, self-efficacy,
sense of belonging, and emotional regulation. With the exception of grit (Cronbach’s
alpha = .58), the scales were internally consistent with alphas ranging from .76 to .81.
Test-retest correlations ranged from .41 to .70. The experimental group engaged in the
Turbo Leader lessons twice per week between the two survey administrations. The
lessons were led by school social workers, classroom teachers, and administrators
who displayed the lessons on smart boards, facilitated discussion, and collected
assignments.

Analyses and Results
We carried out a two-way mixed design MANOVA to determine if there were group
differences in SE skill development over time. There was a significant difference
between groups on the SE competencies (F5,736 = 6.88, p = .00, η² = .05). Two of the
univariate tests were statistically significant. Specifically, the experimental group saw
greater gains in growth mindset (F1,740 = 30.65, p = .00, η² = .04) and self-efficacy (F1,740
= 4.16, p = .04, η² = .01) than the control group (See Figure 1).

Conclusion
This study offers efficacy evidence for the Turbo Leader course and replicates metaanalytic findings documenting positive growth in students participating in SE learning
programs (Mahoney, Durlak, & Weissberg, 2019). Students who engaged in the
curriculum during a full term saw significant growth in growth mindset and self-efficacy,
which are aligned with CASEL’s self-awareness competency (ACT, 2019). Self-efficacy
is associated with a host of positive outcomes, such as increased effort, persistence,
and resilience (Pajares, 1997), and growth mindset interventions are reportedly
effective for improving academic performance (Yeager & Walton, 2011), particularly
among academically high-risk and economically disadvantaged students (Sisk et al.,
2018). Therefore, student development of self-efficacy and growth mindset ought to be
accompanied by positive growth in other associated areas.
