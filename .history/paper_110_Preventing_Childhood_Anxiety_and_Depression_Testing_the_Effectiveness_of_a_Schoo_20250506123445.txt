ABSTRACT
A growing number of school-aged children experience or are at risk for a myriad of psychological and
behavioral problems such as anxiety and depression that interfere with their interpersonal relationships,
school performance, and potential to become productive citizens –hence the importance of school
prevention. This study assessed the effectiveness of the Spanish version of the FRIENDS for Life program
[AMISTAD para siempre], a social and emotional program that uses cognitive-behavioral techniques to
prevent anxiety and depression. Eight schools from a northern city in Mexico were randomly selected and
assigned to either an intervention or standard curriculum instruction. Fifteen teachers implemented the
intervention, and 16 served as control. Participants were 1,030 fourth and fifth grade students (ages 8-13).
The impact of the program was evaluated immediately after the intervention and after 6 months. The
program showed a positive effect by reducing symptoms and risk for depression and increasing the
proactive coping skills of the overall sample. Suggestions for further research and implications for practice
are offered.

La prevención de la ansiedad y de la depresión en la infancia: estudio de la eficacia
de un programa escolar en México
RESUMEN
Un número elevado de niños de edad escolar experimentan o corren el riesgo de experimentar una serie de
problemas psicológicos y de comportamiento tales como la ansiedad y la depresión, las cuales interfieren
en sus relaciones interpersonales, el desempeño académico y el potencial para convertirse en personas
productivas. El presente estudio evalúa la eficacia de la versión en español del programa FRIENDS for Life
[AMISTAD para siempre], que enseña habilidades sociales y emocionales utilizando técnicas cognitivas-conductuales para prevenir ansiedad y depresión. Ocho escuelas de una ciudad al norte de México fueron aleatoriamente seleccionadas y asignadas a un grupo de intervención o al grupo de currículo estándar. Quince
educadoras implementaron el programa y 16 maestras siguieron con el currículo estándar. Los participantes fueron 1.030 niños, de 8 a 13 años de edad, de cuarto y quinto grado de primaria. El impacto del programa se evaluó inmediatamente después de la intervención, y a los seis meses. Los resultados muestran que
el programa tuvo efectos positivos al reducir los síntomas y el riesgo de depresión e incrementar las estrategias de afrontamiento proactivas de aquellos que lo recibieron. Se ofrecen sugerencias sobre futuras investigaciones así como sobre sus implicaciones para la práctica.

A growing number of school-aged children experience or are at
risk for a myriad of psychological and behavioral problems that
interfere with their interpersonal relationships, school performance,
and the potential for becoming productive citizens (Patel &
Sumathipala, 2001; World Health Organization, 2004). Anxiety
disorders, which affect 10 to 20% of children and are the most
prevalent form of psychopathology, have been identified as a salient
concern, particularly because early anxiety symptoms are associated
with deviant conduct, substance abuse, risk for school dropout, and
depression later in life (Caraveo-Anduaga & Comenares-Bermúdez,
2002; Kashani & Orvaschel, 1990; Patel & Sumathipala, 2001).
Depressive disorders affect about 2% of children and 4 to 7% of
adolescents (Costello et al., 2002) and are associated with negative
long-term psychiatric and functional outcomes (Gladstone &
Beardslee, 2009). In addition to the personal suffering experienced
by children and their families, anxiety and depressive disorders
produce a high economic cost to society (Dozois & Westra, 2004);
hence, early prevention and intervention programs in schools are
critical.
Clinical trials have demonstrated that childhood anxiety and
depressive disorders can be treated effectively with individual
cognitive-behavioral interventions (CBT) (Compton, Burns, Egger, &
Roberston, 2002; Kendall & Suveg, 2006; Stark et al., 2006). However,
only treating children who are already experiencing anxiety and
depression may not be the most effective way to stem the growing
number of children who experience emotional difficulties. Therefore,
the potential of prevention programs needs to be investigated.
In the prevention literature, the presence and extent of risk factors
associated with the development of the disorder serve as the basis for
determining the level of intensity of the intervention (Gordon, 1987).
There are three levels of prevention used: universal, selective, and
indicated. Universal interventions are provided to whole populations,
regardless of the individual’s risk status; selective interventions are
provided to groups of individuals at risk for the development of a
disorder; and indicated interventions are provided to individuals with
symptoms that have not yet developed into a disorder.
Research into universal school-based prevention for anxiety and
depression has increased during the last decade yielding promising
results (Gladstone & Beardslee, 2009; Neil & Christensen, 2009).
While several programs have been researched, by and large the most
extensively researched program designed to promote children´s
emotional resilience is the FRIENDS for Life program, a brief cognitivebehavioral intervention.
Studies of the effectiveness of the FRIENDS for Life program have
been conducted at the universal, selective, and indicated level of
prevention and most of them by Barrett´s research team. The first
published study evaluating the program as a universal intervention
was conducted by Barrett and Turner (2001) with 489 children, ages
10 to 12 years old. Results showed that children who received the
program reported a reduction in anxiety symptoms and those
children considered “at risk for anxiety” also reported a reduction of
depressive symptoms. Subsequent studies have also reported similar
results (e.g., Lock & Barrett, 2003; Lowry-Webster, Barrett, & Dadds,
2001), with gains maintained at 12-month follow-up (LowryWebster, Barrett, & Lock, 2003) and at 24 and 36-month follow-up
(Barrett, Farrell, Ollendick, & Dadds, 2006).
Some studies have evaluated the effectiveness of FRIENDS for Life
as a universal intervention in other parts of the world. The first study
was conducted in the United Kingdom and evaluated the effectiveness
of the program implemented by school nurses with 213 children,
ages 9 to 10 years old (Stallard, Simpson, Anderson, Osborn, & Bush,
2005). After completing the program, children reported significant
reductions in anxiety symptoms, an increase in their self-esteem,
and high levels of satisfaction with the program. The study was
replicated by Stallard, Simpson, Anderson, Hibbert, and Osborn in
2007 reporting similar results at posttest with gains being maintained
after one year (Stallard, Simpson, Anderson, & Goddard, 2008). Essau,
Conradt, and Ederer (2004) conducted a study with 200 German
children, ages 9 to 12 years old, and also reported a significant
reduction in children´s anxiety symptoms and high levels of
satisfaction with the program.
The study by Mostert and Loxton (2008) was conducted with
forty six 12-year old children from South Africa and reported no
significant differences between the intervention conditions regarding
children´s anxiety symptoms. For those children receiving the
program they found a significant decrease of anxiety symptoms over
time (Mostert & Loxton, 2008). Rose, Miller and Martinez (2009)
conducted a study with 52 Canadian children, ages 8 to 9 years old,
and also reported no significant differences for anxiety between
intervention conditions.
Although the majority of these studies highlight the potential
benefit of the FRIENDS for Life program, further pragmatic research is
required to demonstrate the benefits of the program in other
countries where the methods of delivery and educational context
might be different (Stallard, Simpson, Anderson, & Goddard, 2008).
Particularly for Hispanic populations, there is a dearth of research
examining anxiety prevention programs. This is the first study that
evaluates the effectiveness of a prevention program for anxiety and
depression conducted with Latin American children in Spanish
language.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the
Spanish-version of the FRIENDS for Life program [AMISTAD para
siempre] for increasing proactive coping skills and reducing and
preventing anxiety and depressive symptoms in Mexican primary
school children.
The research question that guided this study was: What is the
effect of the AMISTAD para siempre program on the coping skills,
anxiety and depressive symptoms, and risk status for anxiety and
depression of fourth-and fifth- grade students? It was hypothesized
that the proactive coping skills of children who participated in the
intervention would increase and that the children would report less
anxiety and depressive symptoms and risk when compared to the
standard curriculum instruction condition.
Method
A quasi-experimental nonequivalent comparison group design
with one between-subject and one within-subject factor was
employed to address the research questions. There were two betweensubject factor levels: (a) intervention condition and (b) standard
curriculum instruction condition. There were three within-subject
factor levels: (a) pretest, (b) posttest, and (c) 6-month follow-up.
Participants
A total of 1,030 students from fourth and fifth grade (ages 8-13)
took part in this study. Students attended schools in a city located in
the Northern Region of Mexico and one of the three cities in Mexico
with the highest prevalence rate for anxiety disorders (Medina-Mora
et al., 2003). This study was implemented as a pilot project of the
Ministry of Education.
All schools in the study were categorized as level six, a metric
used by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística,Geografía e Informática to
stratify the community by socioeconomic status. Level six
communities are low SES and account for 70% of the population.
Characteristics of persons at this level include 91.83% of the
population being able to read and write, 91.85% of the population
aged 6 to 14 go to school, 69.82% of the population aged 12 to 17 go
to school, and 49.91% of the population over 15 years old having a
post primary education (Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Geografía
e Informática, 2006). All schools in the study were coeducational,
had at least two classrooms at each grade 4 and 5, and were served
J. Gallegos et al. / Psicología Educativa 19 (2013) 37-44 39
by Gabinetes de Servicios Educativos [Offices of Educational Services],
a unit within the Special Education Department of the State. Schools,
rather than students, were selected as the unit of random assignment,
and the eight public elementary schools were randomly assigned to
the standard curriculum instruction group (four schools, n = 496
children) and to the intervention group (n = 534). The eight schools
yielded 32 classrooms with 533 fourth and 497 fifth graders (mean
age 9.89 years, range 8-13 years, SD = 0.80). A little over half of the
students were girls (52.6%). Only one teacher from an intervention
school withdrew from the study.
Measures
The following three measures were administered collectively to
all children at pretest, posttest, and 6-month follow-up.
Escala de Ansiedad para Niños de Spence (Spence, 1997) is the
Spanish version of the Spence Children´s Anxiety Scale (SCAS;
Spence, 1997), a self-report measure of anxiety designed for use
with 8-12 year old children. The SCAS consists of 44 items, 38 of
which assess specific anxiety symptoms (e.g., symptoms of social
phobia, separation anxiety, panic attack, and agoraphobia). The
remaining 6 items serve as positive “filter items” in order to reduce
negative response bias. Children are asked to rate, on a 3-point
scale ranging from never (0) to always (2), the frequency with
which they experience each symptom. The total score of this
measure was used in the current study. Psychometric properties
have been examined for the Spanish version, reporting a reliability
coefficient of .91 on the SCAS scores (Bermúdez-Ornelas &
Hernández- Guzman, 2002).
Cuestionario de Depresión Infantil (CDI; Kovacs, 1981) is the
Spanish version of the Children´s Depression Inventory, a self-report
measure used for depressive symptoms in children aged 7 to 17
years. The CDI has 27 items related to the cognitive, affective, and
behavioral signs of depression. Each item contains three statements,
and children select the one statement that best describes them in the
past two weeks. Statements within each item are scored according to
the severity of children´s symptoms: no symptomatology present
(0), mild symptomatology (1), or severe symptomatology (2). A total
score is calculated by summing the statements chosen by the
students. The statement (item 9) that assessed suicidability was
removed. The Spanish version of the CDI has shown good
psychometric properties: a Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficient of
.94 and a test-retest reliability coefficient of .87 and adequate
construct and content validity (Del Barrio, Moreno-Rosset, & LópezMartínez, 1999).
Cuestionario de Afrontamiento (Hernández- Guzman, 2003) is a
Spanish self-report measure developed and standardized in Mexico
to assess coping skills in children aged 6 to 12 years. The scale has 12
items related to child´s interpretation and reactions when facing a
problem and the things he or she does to cope and/or solve the
problem. Lower scores reflect a more proactive positive coping.
Children are asked to rate, on a 3-point scale ranging from never (0)
to always (2), the frequency with which they experience each
statement. The questionnaire assesses coping responses to situations
perceived as stressful and provides information on three factors:
active coping, emotional coping, and passive or avoidant coping. The
Cuestionario de Afrontamiento has demonstrated adequate
psychometric properties including a Cronbach’s alpha reliability
coefficient of .67 (Hernández- Guzmán, 2003).
Protocol integrity measures. Single-informant coding of the
protocol integrity measures was carried out using the Spanish
translation of the Fidelity of Implementation Checklists (Barrett,
2005) on 17% of all sessions. These checklists determine the group
leader’s degree of adherence to the program structure and their
leaders´ skills (e.g., empathy, reflection). Using a Likert-type scale,
the checklist provided four response categories: extremely well (1),
moderately well (2), not very well (3), and not at all (4). Fidelity of
implementation was calculated by averaging the scores of each form
across all the observations of the teachers. The mean for treatment
structure was 2.07 and the mean for teachers´ skills was 1.82,
indicating that the program was implemented moderately well.
Procedure
At pretest, participating children completed the self-report
questionnaires during the school day. Teachers and psychologists
from the Gabinetes de Servicios Educativos read the instructions and
test items aloud to all students and answered questions. Students
were informed that all responses were confidential. Classroom
teachers from the participating schools were released from their
classrooms for a two-day training covering the principles and
practices of prevention and early intervention. The training provided
a step-by-step guide to the intervention program.
Following the pretest phase and the training workshop, the
prevention program was implemented in the intervention schools.
Schools from the standard curriculum instruction group continued
with their regular activities. AMISTAD para siempre (Barrett, 2008a,
2008b) was implemented for 10 consecutive weeks, with one 75
minute session completed once per week. Two booster sessions were
implemented one month and three months after the 10th session.
Students were tested at the completion of the 10th session and all
participants were asked to complete the same measures again 6
months later for follow-up. All children completed the SCAS, CDI, and
the Cuestionario de Afrontamiento.
Children who reported clinical anxiety, a SCAS score of 42 or
above, or clinical depression, a CDI score of 19 or above, were referred
to the school for outside treatment and it is unknown whether they
actually received therapy. The “clinical” cut-off scores were
established before the study began and were suggested by the
authors of the measures.
Intervention protocol and materials
AMISTAD para siempre (Barrett, 2008a, 2008b), the culturally
adapted Spanish version of the FRIENDS for Life program, is a social
and emotional program designed to enhance resilience in children. It
incorporates physiological, cognitive, and behavioral strategies to
assist children in coping with stress and worry. The behavioral
component includes the monitoring of feelings and thoughts, out-ofsession and mental imagery exposure and relaxation training. The
cognitive component teaches children to recognize their feelings and
thoughts and the link between them. It also teaches students to
identify faulty cognitions and incompatible self-statements, and to
elaborate alternative interpretations of difficult situations. Learning
techniques include group discussion, hands-on activities, and roleplay. Approximately one session is dedicated to learn each of the
seven steps represented by the FRIENDS acronym. The Spanish
acronym is parallel to the English in terms of the concepts taught.
After the introductory session, children start to learn the letter F,
which stands for “Feeling worried?” followed by the letter R, “Relax
and feel good; I, “Inner helpful thoughts”; E, “Explore solutions and
coping plans”; N, “Nice work, reward yourself”; D, “Don´t forget to
practice”; and S, “Smile and stay calm”. Within each session the
teacher models the skills and after the skills are taught children have
opportunities to practice in small groups and debrief with the whole
classroom. The program encourages the building of social support
groups and respect for diversity. There are two informational sessions
for parents of about 1.5 hours each. In these sessions parents learn
about the skills and techniques taught in the program, the importance
of family and peer support, and the promotion of the practice of
problem solving rather than avoidance of anxiety-provoking
situations.

Statistical Analysis
Questions were addressed separately using one-tailed
independent sample t-tests (alpha level .05) in order to examine the
dependent variables of anxiety, depression, and coping skills. To
further evaluate the effectiveness of the program, chi-square analyses
were conducted on the SCAS and CDI to examine risk status of
children at each time point. Participants scoring 41 or above on the
SCAS were considered to be “at risk” for anxiety. Children scoring 15
or above on the CDI were considered to be “at risk” for depression.
These numbers were calculated by adding the mean score to 1 SD of
the whole sample at pretest. The preventative impact of the
intervention was measured by a decrease in the severity of symptoms
and by evaluating the change in status. It should be considered that
some prevention programs could show an initial treatment effect
such as a reduction of anxiety and/or depressive symptoms, followed
by a long-term prevention effect.
Results
Preliminary analysis
Levene’s test of homogeneity of variance indicated that at pretest
each outcome measure of anxiety, depression, and coping skills met
the assumption of homogeneity of variance (p > .05, for each). A oneway ANOVA conducted on all outcome measures indicated that the
standard curriculum instruction and intervention groups were not
significantly different at pretest. Children’s levels of anxiety, F(1, 970)
= 3.52, p = .06, depression, F(1, 968) = 0.14, p = .35, and coping skills,
F(1, 971) = 0.01, p = .47 were comparable. There were no significant
differences observed at pretest between the standard curriculum
instruction and intervention groups in their risk for anxiety, χ2(1, n =
972) = 0.58, p = .48 and their risk for depression, χ2(1, n = 970) = 0.49,
p = .45.
Pre-post correlations were calculated for the standard curriculum
instruction condition on the outcome measures that had not been
standardized with a Mexican sample to provide measures of testretest reliability. The pre-post correlations were significant for the
SCAS (r = .66, p = .01) and the CDI (r = .69, p = .01).
Pearson correlations were performed in order to examine the
relationships between the pretest scores of the SCAS, CDI, and CA.
The correlations were positive between the SCAS and the CDI (r = .39,
p = .01), and between the CA and the CDI (r = .24, p = .01). No
statistically significant correlation was found between the SCAS and
CA (r = - .01, p = .77).
Attrition and Missing Data
There were no statistically significant differences in the frequency
of missing data across conditions at posttest (6.82% missing in the
intervention group, 9.89% missing in the standard curriculum
instruction group), χ2(1, n = 1.030) = 3.17, p > .05. In the same way,
there were no statistically significant differences at 6-month followup (17.87% missing in the intervention group, 19.23% missing in the
standard curriculum instruction), χ2(1, n = 1.030) = .32, p > .05.
Reasons for attrition at each time point were absenteeism from
school on the day of assessment, students leaving the school, and
absenteeism from class due to extracurricular activities.
Universal Program Effects
To examine the effect of the intervention for the entire sample
participants´ scores at posttest and 6-month follow-up were
compared between experimental conditions. Table 1 displays the
means and standard deviations of each dependent measure at each
time point. The one-tailed independent sample t-test revealed no
significant differences between groups in the SCAS´s mean scores at
posttest, t (1, 955) = 1.35, p = .09 or at 6-month follow-up, t (1, 850)
= 1.49, p = .07. From the intervention group, 16% were at risk for
anxiety at pretest, 13% at posttest, and 9% at 6-month follow-up.
From the standard curriculum instruction group, 17% were at risk for
anxiety at pretest, 14% at posttest, and 10% at 6-month follow-up.
Chi-square analysis revealed no significant differences in the pattern
of frequencies of children at risk for anxiety at posttest, χ2(1, n = 955)
= 0.34, p = .85 or at 6-month follow-up χ2(1, n = 855) = 0.02, p = .90.
At posttest, the one-tailed independent sample t-tests revealed
significant differences between groups in the CDI mean scores, t (1,
954) = 4.34, p = .01, which yielded an effect size of d = -0.28, which is
considered a small magnitude. At 6-month follow-up, no significant
differences were found between groups on the CDI mean scores, t (1,
846) = 1.41, p = .08. From the intervention group, 16% were at risk for
depression at pretest, 13% at posttest, and 12% at 6-month follow-up.
From the standard curriculum instruction group, 14% were at risk for
depression at pretest, 20% at posttest, and 12% at 6-month follow-up.
Differences were shown in the pattern of frequencies of children at
risk for depression at posttest, χ2(1, n = 954) = 6.76, p = .01 but not at
6-month follow-up, χ2(1, n = 846) = 0.01, p = .91.
One-tailed independent sample t-tests revealed a statistically
significant increase in the proactive coping skills of children from the
intervention group when compared to the standard curriculum
instruction group at posttest, t (1, 955) = 3.98, p = .01 and at 6-month
follow-up t (1, 850) = 2.75, p = .01. The effect size yielded at posttest
was d = -0.26 and at 6-month follow-up d = -0.19, which are
considered a small magnitude.
Discussion
Prevention of anxiety and depressive disorders is very important
as these are common problems among children that, if left untreated,
may lead to a broad range of negative consequences for the child and
his or her family (Kashani & Orvaschel, 1990; World Health
Organization, 2004). Findings from this study revealed that at pretest
almost 2 out of 10 Mexican children were experiencing some
symptoms of anxiety or depression. A recent study conducted by
Benjet, Borges, Medina-Mora, Zambrano, and Aguilar-Gaxiola (2009)
has reported even higher rates of anxiety and depression among
Mexican youth, suggesting that these problems escalate over time. It
was estimated that about 40% of Mexican youth had experienced a
mental health problem, anxiety being the most common, followed
by impulse-control disorders, affective disorders, and substance
abuse (Benjet et al., 2009). The latter study also found that only 14%

of the adolescents who reported a mental health problem received
help. Various forms of help were reported, including psychological
treatment, a visit to a medical doctor, reading a self-help book, selfmedication, herbal medicine, or talking to a priest. Therefore,
research on the prevention of anxiety and depression in developing
countries such as Mexico is crucial.
Children who received the program demonstrated increased
proactive coping skills and a decrease in depressive symptoms and
risk for depression. These findings are similar to findings that have
been reported by other researchers (Barrett, Lock, & Farrell, 2005;
Lock & Barrett, 2003; Lowry-Webster et al., 2001). This suggests that
providing a universal prevention program is an effective strategy in
promoting mental health. The fact that the intervention can be
delivered by classroom teachers is an added benefit that adds to the
cost-effectiveness of the strategy since a large number of children
can be reached over a relatively short period of time (Dozois &
Westra, 2004).
However, the non-significant finding for anxiety symptoms was
unexpected and differed from the findings of other studies (e.g.,
Lowry-Webster et al., 2001). A recent systematic review conducted
by Neil and Christensen (2009) on the efficacy and effectiveness of
school-based prevention and early intervention programs for anxiety
has reported that three-quarters of the trials that were analyzed
showed a significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety. There are
several possible explanations for the lack of significant differences.
First, it could be the result of a sleeper effect in which significant
changes appear later in time, similar to what Barrett et al. (2006)
found. Second, it is possible that the Spanish version of the SCAS
measure was not sensitive enough to the culture of Mexican children.
Pretest correlations between the coping skills measure and the SCAS
were not statistically significant in this study. Previous studies have
found an increase in participants’ proactive coping skills and a
decrease in anxiety symptoms after the intervention (e.g., Lock &
Barrett, 2003), suggesting the possibility that translated scales may
not be equivalent to original scales.
The third possibility is that the program was implemented less
consistently than it was in other studies. This study reported that the
program was implemented “moderately well”, but it is unknown
whether this could be the cause as no other published studies of the
program have included data regarding the fidelity of implementation.
Results from a meta-analysis conducted by Fisak, Richard, and Mann
(2011) showed that studies conducted in Australia (most of them
using the FRIENDS for Life program) yielded higher effect sizes than
those studies conducted at another location (d = .30 vs. .12). This
suggests that more research is required to evaluate the degree of
effectiveness of the FRIENDS for Life program in other countries. Last,
it could be also that the program in its current format did not work
for this outcome in the population of Mexican children. This was the
first adaptation of the program and further aspects related to the
Mexican culture and manifestations of anxiety will be taken into
account in order to work towards a better and more culturally
sensitive adaptation of the program.
Finally, when interpreting the findings of this study it is necessary
to take into account the school/teacher differences between Mexico
and the other countries where the FRIENDS for Life program has been
tested (e.g., Australia, England, Germany). Differences such as the
number of children per classroom (40 children vs. typically 25 in
developed countries), absence of a teacher assistant, classroom
teachers who usually work two shifts (about 10 -12 hours per day)
due to economic struggles, and teachers´ limited opportunities for
continuing professional development, may have influenced the
results of the program. Classroom teachers who implemented the
program expressed through informal conversations that for a more
effective implementation major school changes are needed, starting
with a greater support for those implementing the program. They
also pointed the need for assistance with workload management and
the provision of more information about mental health promotion
and resilience in communities. This vision of multi-sectorial
involvement in the promotion of community mental health has also
been stated as a priority in other implementation studies (Patel &
Sumathipala, 2001).
Limitations of the Study
Although this study attempted to avoid some of the methodological
shortcomings of previous school-based research, there are still some
limitations that should be taken into account when interpreting the
findings. First, the effectiveness of the program was primarily
evaluated through children´s self-reported measures, which rely on
their subjective perceptions. Therefore, further studies should
include multiple informants and qualitative measures such as
interviews and focus groups. Second, another limitation was the
dearth of measures that targeted positive or strength-based
outcomes such as optimism, empathy, quality of peer relationships,
or social skills. Especially when working at the universal level of
prevention it is crucial to incorporate more measures of positive
outcomes, as most of the population is non-clinical.
Third, due to financial constraints, single informant coding was
carried out for the protocol integrity measures and no long-term
evaluation was conducted. For the same reason, the informational
sessions for parents were no sufficiently promoted. The ideal
promotion would have included sending several written reminders
of the sessions, offering some tea/coffee and crackers, and providing
attendance rewards such as other parental resources or participating
in raffle (Neil & Christensen, 2009). Fourth, an important limitation
of this study was not being able to follow-up those cases that scored
above clinical cut-off and were referred to teachers and parents.
Thus, caution should be paid when analyzing the results at 6-month
follow-up.
Conclusion
Most of the research on the prevention of anxiety and depression
has been conducted in developed countries with high SES
populations. Patel and Sumathipala (2001) reported that “mental
health research in low and middle income countries contributes
barely to 3-6% of all published mental health research in the world,
and research focusing on children is even smaller”. This is the first
study examining the school-based prevention of mental health
problems in Mexican children and it is an innovative first step in
examining how prevention programs might be implemented in
developing countries that due to their social and financial constraints
are in urgent need of help.
Further studies should continue exploring the effects of the
AMISTAD para siempre program as a tool to promote emotional
resilience in classrooms. Working towards effective prevention is
crucial as anxiety and depression can lead to negative consequences
such as substance abuse and deviant conduct, which may limit
children from reaching their maximal potential.
