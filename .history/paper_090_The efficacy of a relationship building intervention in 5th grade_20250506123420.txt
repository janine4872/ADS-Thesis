Abstract
The present study reports initial efficacy data for a new school-based intervention – the Relationship Building Intervention (RBI) – that includes a series of teacher-facilitated, structured activities designed to promote positive peer relationships and inclusive classroom communities. The RBI was evaluated in fifth-grade classrooms by estimating multilevel model (MLM) analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) comparing 368 fifth-grade students in intervention classrooms with 259 fifth-graders in control classrooms on social behaviors, perceptions of classroom connectedness, and academic performance. Controlling for pretest scores, cohort, and demographic variables, findings revealed that students who participated in the RBI liked school more, felt a greater sense of classroom identification and inclusion, were perceived by teachers to be less aggressive, and performed better academically than students who were in control classrooms. Further, implementation data showed that students and teachers responded positively to the activities. These results suggest that the RBI is a promising approach for improving the social and learning environment in fifth-grade classrooms.

1. Introduction
Social factors play a key role in children's academic success (Caprara et al., 2000, Malecki and Elliott, 2002, Welsh et al., 2001), as evidenced by longitudinal data showing that elementary school students' prosocial and empathic behaviors predict increases in standardized achievement test scores (e.g., Malecki & Elliott, 2002) and grades (Caprara et al., 2000, Welsh et al., 2001). Findings from studies such as these suggest that social skills help pave the way for academic success by promoting key academic enablers such as the development of positive peer relationships (Ladd, Kockenderfer-Ladd, Visconti, & Ettekal, 2012) and feelings of school connectedness (e.g., Valiente et al., 2007, Wentzel, 2009). Positive peer relationships in classrooms are associated with academic motivation, engagement in learning, and school-related accomplishments (Wentzel, Donlan, & Morrison, 2012) and increase the likelihood that instructional practices, especially ones involving peer collaboration, promote learning (Ladd et al., 2012). In contrast, children who exhibit behaviors that reflect low levels of social skill, such as aggression and defiance, tend to dislike school, have difficulty forming positive peer relations, and are at greater risk for academic difficulties (e.g., Hinshaw, 1992, Ladd and Burgess, 2001). Together, these patterns of findings suggest that fostering positive social development in schools facilitates the mission of academic excellence.
Although there are a number of school-based curricula available that aim to improve social and academic outcomes, most of these programs focus primarily on the development of individual-level skills (e.g., emotion regulation). In the present study, we introduce a new intervention that not only targets the development of social skills, but also directly addresses key context and peer relationship processes that contribute to students' academic success. The Relationship Building Intervention (RBI; Miller et al., 2015) is a universal school-based intervention for elementary school children, consisting of structured activities designed to promote classroom environments that are collaborative, inclusive, and conducive to the development and maintenance of positive peer relationships and academic success. The RBI is grounded in contemporary theories (e.g., intergroup contact theory, Allport, 1954, Pettigrew et al., 2011; cognitive theories of gender development, Martin, Ruble, & Szkrybalo, 2002) and empirical research on intergroup relationships, intervention science, education, and child development. The activities in the RBI consist of a series of developmentally appropriate, teacher-facilitated experiential exercises that promote relationship building skills such as empathy, communication, problem solving, diversity appreciation, and friendship formation and support. The present study represents the first test of the efficacy of the RBI in improving social behavior, school connectedness, and academic achievement in a sample of fifth-grade students.
1.1. Overview and theoretical basis of RBI
The primary goal of the RBI is to foster peer interactions and connections that are positively toned, meaningful, and respectful. The RBI draws on the social and emotional learning (SEL) approach in that it involves the implementation of structured activities that are designed to promote key competencies, create supportive learning environments, and prevent the underlying causes of problem behavior (Greenberg et al., 2003). The RBI also provides opportunities for children to learn key social and emotional skills, as identified by The Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) – namely, self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision-making (CASEL, 2012). The assumption is that when children acquire these five competencies, they will be equipped with the tools needed to achieve positive socio-emotional adjustment and academic performance.
Research has demonstrated that SEL interventions can be implemented successfully and can positively impact students' socio-emotional and academic abilities (Durlak et al., 2011, Sklad et al., 2012). For example, results from a meta-analysis of 213 school-based, universal SEL programs showed that students who participated in SEL programs demonstrated improved socio-emotional skills and classroom behavior, fewer conduct problems, and reduced emotional distress (Durlak et al., 2011). Analyses also revealed that students who participated in SEL programs, relative to those who did not, averaged 11 percentile points higher on achievement tests (Durlak et al., 2011). A similar meta-analysis focusing specifically on contemporary school-based, universal SEL programs produced similar results, showing positive effects of SEL programs on socio-emotional skills, self-image, mental health, substance abuse, antisocial behavior, prosocial behavior, and academic achievement (Sklad et al., 2012). Taken together, there is considerable evidence that supports the view that SEL programming is valuable for students and should be a part of the mission of teaching and learning in schools.
Although traditional SEL programs typically focus on teaching and practicing individual-centered social-emotional skills, research indicates that social-environmental factors also influence school success (Ryan and Ladd, 2012, Wentzel and Muenks, 2016). Evidence suggests that students' perceptions of their classroom and school social climate, including belongingness and cohesion, are predictive of scholastic engagement and achievement (Goodenow, 1993, Master and Walton, 2013, Ryan and Patrick, 2001, Walton et al., 2012). For instance, students who perceive that their peers are emotionally supportive are more likely to positively identify with school (Wang & Eccles, 2012) and show positive school engagement (e.g., Nelson & DeBacker, 2008). Moreover, research has consistently found that peers are among the most important socializers of academic competence (Wentzel, 2009) and that acceptance from peers is positively associated with academic achievement (e.g., Buhs and Ladd, 2001, Oberle and Schonert-Reichl, 2013). Consequently, the RBI was designed to move beyond a focus on individual-centered skill development (e.g., building self-awareness, regulating emotions) that typifies most SEL programs by also incorporating elements that specifically target context and peer relationship factors. For example, in the RBI, students participate in experiential activities that are designed to promote inclusion and a positive relational environment. Furthermore, all activities occur within the peer context; students learn, practice, and reflect on concepts in dyads, small groups, and within the whole classroom. Students are also explicitly taught developmentally appropriate cognitive and social skills that encourage the development of positive relationships with a diverse group of peers. Thus, the RBI represents a novel advance over many SEL programs by paying particular attention to the role of context and peer relationships.
The RBI aims to equip students with the social, emotional, and cognitive competencies needed to establish meaningful peer connections and to successfully interact with diverse peer groups in structured and unstructured contexts. It does so in a way that is consistent with current research on the factors that make some programs more effective than others. In their meta-analysis of school-based programs, Durlak et al. (2011) found that programs that incorporated “SAFE” practices were more effective than programs that did not. SAFE practices include: sequenced sets of activities, active forms of learning, a focus on developing personal or social skills, and an explicit focus on specific SEL skills (see Durlak et al., 2011 for additional descriptions regarding these practices). The development of the RBI was informed by these criteria. For instance, the RBI utilizes a set of developmentally appropriate, sequential activities for elementary school children that expand on the skills and concepts taught in previous years. Moreover, RBI activities promote active involvement by incorporating games, hands-on activities, role plays, and group discussions. The guiding assumption underlying the RBI approach is that students learn best when they have opportunities to actively participate in experiences that enable them to practice key skills and discover ideas in a personally meaningful manner.
Several theories also informed the RBI approach. For instance, unlike more traditional SEL programs, a primary goal of the RBI is to bring together classmates who may not typically interact with one another, thereby improving their sense of connection. This idea is grounded in intergroup contact theory (Allport, 1954), which posits that attitudes about, and behavior towards, others can be improved by interacting with members of the other group, and that intergroup contact is especially influential when conducted under favorable conditions (i.e., intergroup cooperation, institutional support, being of equal status, and having common goals). Hundreds of studies designed to evaluate the effects of intergroup contact confirm that bringing people together who are from different backgrounds is an effective way to improve intergroup attitudes (Pettigrew and Tropp, 2006, Pettigrew et al., 2011). Similarly, the RBI activities are designed to promote a sense of classroom unity, which, according to the common ingroup identity model, should reduce intergroup bias as members of different groups are encouraged to conceive of themselves as part of the same group (see Gaertner & Dovidio, 2000).
Promoting and supporting intergroup interactions also involves equipping students with the competencies needed to successfully interact with diverse groups of peers in structured and unstructured contexts. Thus, based on current best practices for teaching and supporting social skills, students who participate in the RBI are provided with ample opportunities to learn, rehearse, and obtain feedback on communication, problem solving, and friendship skills (Frey, Elliot, & Miller, 2014). Guided by cognitive-behavioral and social-cognitive approaches, students who receive the RBI also participate in experiential activities that illustrate how their cognitions influence their feelings and behaviors (e.g., Friedberg & MacClure, 2015) and the benefits associated with having cognitions that are flexible and unbiased (e.g., Pahlke, Bigler, & Martin, 2014). Although the skill-based components of the RBI overlap with the skills taught in traditional SEL programs (e.g., problem-solving), the activities in the RBI focus on developing competencies that have implications for forming positive and diverse peer relationships at school (e.g., solving conflicts, cooperating with diverse peers during group tasks).
1.2. The present study
Given that the RBI is new and the need for evaluation is high, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of the RBI as it impacts fifth-grade students' relational, contextual, and academic outcomes. Using a quasi-experimental nonequivalent comparison group design, we expected that fifth-graders participating in the RBI would demonstrate more positive social behaviors (i.e., prosociality and low aggression), report improved feelings of school connectedness (i.e., school liking and classroom identification/inclusion), and earn better school grades relative to children in control classrooms. To examine implementation processes, we assessed fidelity, students' comprehension of RBI concepts, and both teachers' and students' responsiveness to the RBI.
2. Method
2.1. Participants
The present study was carried out for two consecutive years with two separate cohorts of fifth-grade students. A fifth-grade sample was chosen for the present study because, beginning in early adolescence, the salience of peer relationships intensifies (Rubin, Bukowski, & Parker, 2006); thus, this age group was optimal for our initial testing of the RBI. The total sample included 627 fifth-grade students and their classroom teachers who were recruited from six elementary schools in a large metropolitan area in the southwestern U.S. The RBI activities were implemented with a total of 368 fifth-graders (Cohort 1 = 139; Cohort 2 = 229) across 15 classrooms (five of these classrooms included teachers who participated in both cohorts) within two schools. Children in the control condition included 259 fifth-graders (Cohort 1 = 60; Cohort 2 = 199) across 14 classrooms within four schools. The average class sizes for intervention and control classrooms were 28.25 students and 27.25 students, respectively. All participating schools resided within one suburban school district.
At the onset of the study, the fifth-grade students (52.5% female) averaged 10.02 years of age (SD = 0.40) and came from diverse ethnic backgrounds (55.5% European American, 9.4% Hispanic/Latino, 8.0% Asian American, 3.8% Black/African American, 1.1% Native American, 0.2% Pacific Islander, 17.9% Multiracial, and 4.1% non-respondents). Median annual household income ranged from $90,000 to $99,000, and the level of education obtained by participants' primary caregiver was some or all of high school (7.5%), some or all of college (65.5%), master's or advanced (i.e., doctorate, medical, law) degree (21.9%), and unavailable (5.1%). Most students were living in two-parent households (75.1%); the majority of these students lived with their biological parents (91.2%). Eighty percent of teachers and 51.4% of students assigned to the RBI group were female; 86% of teachers and 54.1% of students assigned to the control condition were female.
Following approval by the University and School District Institutional Review Boards, we began recruitment at the school level. Twenty-nine classrooms and 24 teachers agreed to participate (as noted, 5 teachers participated in both cohorts of the study). At pretest this included 612 students, and at posttest, 618 students, for a total of 627 students. Nine of these students only participated in the pretest and 15 additional students completed only the posttest because they moved into study classrooms during the school year. Attrition analyses comparing those with complete data versus those with only one data point, either pre- or posttest, on pretest demographic and study variables revealed one significant finding: youth in the control group had a small but larger percentage of missing data (5.8%) than youth in the RBI group (2.4%), χ2 (1) = 5.01, p < 0.05.
2.2. Procedure
2.2.1. Program implementation
The RBI consists of 21 activities across five units: Diversity and Inclusion, Empathy and Critical Thinking, Communication, Problem Solving, and Peer Relationships (see Table 1). For recruitment, we first identified intervention schools based on the willingness of principals and teachers to implement the RBI. We then recruited control schools within the same district with the goal of identifying schools that were relatively similar with regard to demographic characteristics (e.g., percentage of ethnic minority population and students eligible for free/reduced lunch). We used separate schools for intervention and control classrooms to reduce the likelihood of contamination effects (Craven, Marsh, Debus, & Jayasinghe, 2001). The parents of students in participating schools were informed of the study and its voluntary nature via a letter from the principal investigators. Seventy-eight percent of parents provided informed consent, and 97.5% of youth with parental consent provided written assent and participated in the study.
Table 1. Relationship building intervention units.

RBI units	Overall goal	Activity descriptions
Diversity and Inclusion	To promote an inclusive environment and a common classroom identity	Students are provided with opportunities to get to know each other and are taught to recognize and appreciate each other's similarities and differences. Students develop a common classroom identity by working together to develop a classroom name and motto.
Empathy and Critical Thinking	To facilitate an awareness of the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors; to promote empathy and incremental thinking; to reduce stereotyped thinking	Students engage in interactive exercises and games to become aware of how their thoughts influence their feelings and behaviors, to learn the skills associated with empathic responding, to recognize the malleability of human traits and abilities, and to identify the consequences associated with stereotyped thinking.
Communication	To foster the use of effective communication skills during social interactions and cooperative work groups	Students participate in observational and experiential exercises to increase their awareness of healthy and unhealthy communication patterns. Students practice using effective communication skills and avoiding ineffective communication skills in cooperative learning group activities.
Problem Solving	To cultivate the ability to solve interpersonal problems effectively	Students participate in activities to identify different types of conflict styles and the benefits and costs associated with each style. Students learn and practice a step-by-step approach for successfully resolving interpersonal conflicts and are encouraged to use this approach whenever conflicts arise at school.
Peer Relationships	To encourage supportive interactions and friendships among classmates	Students participate in activities to consider the qualities important to friendships, to develop strategies for minimizing the costs associated with cross-gender friendships, to learn effective responses for dealing with bullying situations, and to practice providing peers with support.
Prior to data collection, the program developers administered a half-day training at each intervention school. The goal of the training was to provide teachers with the knowledge and skills needed to implement the RBI successfully. Training was primarily didactic and discussion-based, and included (a) a rationale for the intervention; (b) an overview of intervention goals, core concepts, units, and methods; (c) instruction on utilizing inclusive language and organizational practices; and (d) a discussion of the implementation schedule and activity format. Teachers were provided binders that included a detailed description and script for each activity and all supplemental materials (e.g., activity handouts, activity logs, etc.). Each teacher also received a kit that included all of the game materials, posters, and video clips needed to implement the activities. To increase the likelihood of effective implementation, teachers had the opportunity to ask questions throughout the training and to discuss strategies for how they would successfully implement the program in their classrooms.
As recommended during the training, following pretest data collection, teachers in the intervention classrooms began implementing approximately one activity each week beginning in late-August and extending through mid-March (i.e., over the course of approximately 26 weeks). Activities averaged about 45 min/week (M = 46.67, SD = 3.86), and 94% of teachers reported that they felt the length of the activities was appropriate. Teacher-reported student attendance was consistently high, with 69% of students attending all activities; the mean number of absences per student across all activities was < 1 (M = 0.49, SD = 0.94). We utilized a non-treatment “education-as-usual” control group; therefore, during the implementation period, the control group students participated in their regularly scheduled education activities.
2.2.2. Survey administration
Using a quasi-experimental nonequivalent comparison group design (Shadish, Cook, & Campbell, 2002), data were collected from student surveys in the intervention and control schools in the fall (i.e., pretest; August/September) and spring (i.e., posttest; February/March) of the 2010–2011 (Cohort 1: n = 199) and 2011–2012 (Cohort 2: n = 428) school years. Pretest data were collected prior to the onset of the intervention and posttest data were collected immediately after the intervention ended in treatment schools. Research staff administered pretest and posttest surveys to participants in their classrooms during two one-hour sessions that were conducted over the course of two days each. The questionnaires were read aloud to the entire class and the students were asked to follow along and answer questions as they were read. While one survey administrator read the items aloud, a minimum of one additional administrator assisted students who had difficulties with any of the questions. At each wave of data collection, students received a pencil and snack as compensation for their participation. Students also received a pizza party upon completion of the posttest data collection.
Questionnaires were distributed to participating teachers who were asked to complete and return them within two weeks. To partially compensate teachers and schools for their time and effort, all teachers received a personal payment of $200 for completing pretest and posttest questionnaires, and each classroom received $150 for classroom supplies. The teachers in the intervention group received an additional personal payment of $275 for implementing the intervention and completing weekly process data.
2.3. Measures
Demographic information was collected from students' primary caregivers at pretest. Caregivers reported on students' gender and ethnicity (Asian, Black/African American, Latino/Hispanic, Native American, Pacific Islander, White/Caucasian/European American, Multiracial), annual household income (below $20 K, $20 K–$29 K, $30 K–$39 K, $40 K–$49 K, $50 K–$59 K, $60 K–$69 K, $70 K–$79 K, $80 K–$89 K, $90 K–$99 K, $100 K or more) and parents' highest level of education (some high school, graduated high school/GED, some college/Associates degree, college graduate, Master's degree, Doctorate/Medical/Law). Given that gender plays a key role in the development and maintenance of peer relationships in preadolescence (e.g., Rose & Rudolph, 2006), students' gender was considered as a moderator of program effects. To adjust for the potential effects of selection bias (discussed below), student ethnicity, household income, parents' education level, and pretest reports of the outcome variables were included as control variables.
2.3.1. Outcome data
To assess the effects of the RBI on social, contextual, and academic outcomes, we measured students' social behaviors, perceptions of school connectedness, and grades.
2.3.2. Social behaviors
Teachers completed the Prosocial and Aggressive Behavior subscales of the Child Behavior Scale (CBS; Ladd et al., 2009, Ladd and Profilet, 1996). Teachers were instructed to rate on a 3-point scale (1 = doesn't apply, 2 = applies sometimes, 3 = certainly applies) how characteristic each statement was of participating students' behavior when interacting with their classmates within the past two weeks. Sample statements for the prosocial (7 items) and aggressive behavior (7 items) subscales include: “A student who helps” (prosocial) and “A student who taunts/teases” (aggressive). Both subscales were found to demonstrate adequate internal consistency reliability within the current sample (pretest α = 0.84, posttest α = 0.89 for prosocial behavior; pretest α = 0.81, posttest α = 0.84 for aggressive behavior). A previous examination of the stability of subscale scores among a large sample of participants followed prospectively from kindergarten to 8th grade revealed moderate (r = 0.33–0.45) and high (r = 0.56–0.68) one-lag stabilities for the prosocial and externalizing behavior subscales, respectively, with the latter subscale including the aggressive behavior subscale items (Ladd et al., 2009). In the present study, the stability coefficients from pretest to posttest for the prosocial and aggressive behavior subscales were 0.52 and 0.58, respectively.
2.3.3. School connectedness
Students completed two measures within this domain: one assessing school liking and the other assessing classroom identification/inclusion. First, students completed a 9-item school liking subscale from the School Liking and Avoidance Questionnaire (SLAQ; Ladd & Price, 1987). Participants were instructed to rate each item on a 5-point scale (0 = almost never, 1 = not much (just a little), 2 = sometimes, 3 = a lot, 4 = almost always) to indicate the extent to which they like school (e.g., “School is fun” and “I like being in school”). Cronbach's alphas were high at pretest and posttest (αs = 0.94). The stability coefficient for school liking was 0.65.
As a measure of classroom identification and inclusion, students completed an adapted version of the Classroom Identification and Participation subscale of the Psychological Sense of School Membership Scale (PSSM; Goodenow, 1993). Students used a 5-point scale (0 = almost never, 1 = not much (just a little), 2 = sometimes, 3 = a lot, 4 = almost always) to respond to eight items. Six items were original subscale items (see Ye & Wallace, 2013); however, because the original subscale did not index classroom inclusion, we also included two additional items to more fully capture this construct. Examples of the original PSSM items include: “I feel like a part of the classroom” and “I feel as though I don't belong in this classroom” (reverse scored). The two additional items were: “Kids in my class make sure everyone feels included” and “My classroom feels like a team.” A confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that the eight items were indicators of a single latent factor that fit the data adequately, χ2(N = 598, df = 16) = 96.45, CFI = 0.95, SRMR = 0.03. Alphas for the 8-item scale were 0.82 and 0.84 at pretest and posttest, respectively, and the stability coefficient was 0.60.
2.3.4. Academic achievement
As an indicator of academic achievement, students' grades were accessed via report cards: 0 = unsatisfactory (F), 1 = having difficulty (D), 2 = satisfactory (C), 3 = very good (B), 4 = outstanding (A) at pretest (Quarter 1) and posttest (Quarter 4), respectively. Quarter 1 grades were issued approximately one month following the beginning of the intervention and Quarter 4 grades were issued approximately two months following the end of the intervention. An overall mean grade was calculated from reports in five subject areas: language, writing, math, science, and social studies.
2.3.5. Implementation data
To assess implementation processes and bolster confidence in our findings, data were collected to assess fidelity (i.e., dosage, adherence, and quality), students' responsiveness to the RBI, teachers' and students' self-reported satisfaction with the intervention, and students' ability to comprehend and retain the material presented in the activities.
2.3.6. Program fidelity and student responsiveness
To ascertain dosage, teachers completed an activity log tracking the date that they completed and the length of each activity. The data for adherence, implementation quality, and student responsiveness were collected by observing and videotaping teachers as they implemented the activities. The observational system included four items for adherence (e.g., Did the teacher discuss the talking points within the script?), five items for implementation quality (e.g., Did the teacher exhibit enthusiasm/positive emotions?), and three items for student responsiveness (e.g., How many students in the class seemed focused during the lesson?). Adherence and implementation quality items were rated on a 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much) scale and the items for student responsiveness were rated on a 0 (none) to 3 (most/all) scale. All activities were videotaped at least once during both years of the study; in Year 1, the five teachers were each videotaped implementing 4–5 activities and, in Year 2, the 10 teachers were each videotaped implementing 2–3 activities. Two coders familiar with the RBI and trained on assessing program implementation watched all of the videos (N = 43 videos); inter-rater reliability coefficients for adherence (ICC = 0.79), implementation quality (ICC = 0.79), and student responsiveness (ICC = 0.79) were satisfactory. To obtain subscale scores, the ratings for both coders were averaged together for each item and then the item scores within each subscale were averaged together to create overall adherence (α = 0.70), implementation quality (α = 0.62), and student responsiveness (α = 0.77) scores.
2.3.7. Program acceptability
Upon completion of each of the five units of the RBI, teachers responded to a 15-item measure that indexed program satisfaction (e.g., “I felt comfortable facilitating activities within this unit”; 0 = not at all to 3 = a lot; αs = 0.75–0.94). Students also completed a 15-item satisfaction measure (e.g., “Activities in this unit were helpful to me”; 0 = not at all to 3 = a lot; αs = 0.89–0.93) following each of the units. Thus, teachers and students completed the satisfaction measure five times during the study (i.e., one time for each unit).
2.3.8. Knowledge of RBI concepts
At the end of the Empathy and Critical Thinking, Communication, Problem Solving, and Peer Relationships Units, students participating in the RBI completed quizzes on the concepts and skills taught during the activities. Example items include: “What are the two skills of empathy?” (Empathy and Critical Thinking Unit) and “List the four communication bloopers” (Communication Unit). The questions on the quizzes were curriculum-specific and designed to assess if students understood and remembered the concepts presented during the activities. Quizzes were not administered for the Diversity and Inclusion Unit because this unit primarily included experiential and community building exercises.
2.4. Data analysis
Hypotheses were tested using three sets of analyses. First, we used a quasi-experimental nonequivalent comparison group design to examine pretest mean differences between the control and intervention groups. Second, we examined the effects of the RBI on social, school connectedness, and academic achievement outcomes using multilevel model (MLM) analyses of covariance (ANCOVA; Maxwell & Delaney, 2004). This model allowed us to address the limitations of our design (i.e., selection bias) and account for our nested data. Third, as this study was an initial evaluation of the evidence for the RBI's efficacy to engage students and teachers and produce change in students' social, school connectedness, and academic achievement outcomes, we examined implementation data descriptively (i.e., fidelity, students' responsiveness, students' knowledge of RBI concepts, and students' and teachers' self-reported satisfaction) by reporting frequencies and means for these constructs. Correlations between the study variables are presented in Table 2.

3. Results
3.1. Pretest differences
First, we used chi-square analysis and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) or analysis of variance (ANOVA) to identify any mean differences at pretest between the control and intervention groups on demographic (i.e., household income, parents' education level, students' ethnicity) and outcome measures, respectively. For the demographic variables, chi-square analyses revealed differences by condition for household income, χ2(9) = 75.91, p < 0.001, parents' education level, χ2(5) = 21.00, p < 0.01, and student ethnicity, χ2(6) = 24.83, p < 0.001. In particular, students in the RBI group were in families with a greater proportion of high annual household income ($30 K–49 K: 7.2% vs. 23%; $60 K–69 K: 1.8% vs. 7.1%; $100 k or more: 62% vs. 29.3%) as compared to students in the control group, respectively. Students in the RBI group had parents with a higher proportion of masters' (20.3% vs. 13.4%) or doctorate degrees (7.2% vs. 3.3%) as compared to students in the control group, respectively. Alternatively, students in the control group had parents with higher proportions of some college or associates degrees (38.6% vs. 25.8%) as compared to students in the RBI group, respectively. Students in the control group were more likely to identify as Latino/Hispanic (15.7% vs. 5.7%) as compared to students in the RBI group, respectively. Students in the RBI group were more likely to identify as White/Caucasian/European American (63.2% vs. 50.4%) as compared to students in the control group, respectively.
For the outcome variables, starting with social behaviors, the MANOVA revealed a condition effect, F (2, 606) = 10.20, p < 0.001; Wilk's Λ = 0.967, partial η2 = 0.03. Follow-up analysis revealed that there were significant effects for both prosocial behavior and aggressive behavior, with students in the control group being perceived by their teachers to demonstrate higher levels of both prosocial and aggressive behaviors than those in the RBI group (see Table 3). Turning to the school connectedness variables, the MANOVA indicated a condition effect, F (2, 593) = 8.73, p < 0.001; Wilk's Λ = 0.971, partial η2 = 0.03. Follow-up analysis revealed significant effects for both variables, with students in the RBI group reporting higher levels of school liking and classroom identification/inclusion than students in the control group (see Table 3). For overall grades, the ANOVA indicated a condition effect, such that students in the RBI group had higher grades than students in the control group (see Table 3). To adjust for the potential effects of selection bias as indicated by the pretest differences between groups, we included pretest measures of our dependent variables and demographic (i.e., household income, parents' education, ethnicity, cohort) variables as covariates in all subsequent analyses (Maxwell & Delaney, 2004).

3.2. Evaluation of RBI effects on outcome variables
To assess the effects of the RBI, we estimated two-level MLM ANCOVAs with random effects as mixed models using SAS PROC MIXED (Singer, 1998). This analytic approach took into account the hierarchical nesting created by the sampling employed in this study; students (Level-1) were nested within teachers/classrooms (Level-2). Estimates of the design effects (i.e., ranged from 1 to 1.37) and random variance components (i.e., did not differ significantly from 0, p < 0.05) for the impact of school suggested minimal to no random school effects for our outcomes; thus, the random effect of school was not included in our analyses. Intent-to-treat analyses retained all participants who were in the intervention or control classrooms regardless of attendance. Covariates were included in the model either because they (a) showed pretest differences (i.e., pretest measures of outcomes, family household income, and parents' education level) or (b) were related to the posttest outcome variables (i.e., cohort and student ethnicity). The student-level (Level-1) covariates included pretest reports of the outcome variables, student ethnicity (0 = European American, 1 = minority), parents' education level, and household income. Student gender (0 = girls, 1 = boys) was also included as a moderator and was a student-level (Level-1) variable. The one classroom-level (Level-2) covariate was cohort (0 = the academic year of 2010–2011, 1 = 2011–2012). As teachers/classrooms were assigned to either the RBI or the control conditions, assignment to condition was modeled as a dummy-coded contrast variable (0 = control, 1 = RBI) at the classroom level (Level-2). The gender by condition interaction was a cross-level interaction. All continuous variables were group mean centered. The evaluation of the interaction effect indicates the degree to which the condition effects were moderated by student gender. The Kenward-Rogers method (Kenward & Rogers, 1997) was used to determine the denominator degrees of freedom for all tests of fixed effects and all tests of fixed effects were two-tailed hypothesis tests. Final parameter estimates for both fixed and random effects were obtained through maximum likelihood (ML) estimation (Allison, 2012).
Intraclass correlations (ICC) ranged from 0.02 to 0.41 (see Table 4), suggesting that there was a moderate amount of dependence within Level-2 units (classrooms) and that a MLM framework was appropriate. The proportion of variance explained (or proportional reduction in variance) by the Level-2 variables (the combined effect of condition and cohort) was calculated using the Level-2 intercept variance from the model with just the Level-1 variables and the Level-2 intercept variance from the model with the Level-2 variables added (Peugh, 2010). It can be interpreted in the same way as a squared multiple correlation (e.g., the Level-1/Level-2 predictor variables explained a proportion of the intercept variance). Additionally, effect sizes were calculated as the parameter estimate for the condition effect (i.e., the difference in the outcome means for experimental and control classrooms, γ) divided by the pooled standard deviation (i.e., the square root of the within group variance, σ; Tymms, 2004). An effect size (ES) of | 0.80 | may be considered large, | 0.50 | medium, and | 0.20 | small (Schagen & Elliot, 2004).

3.2.1. Social behaviors
There was a small effect (ES = − 0.34) of condition on teachers' reports of students' aggressive behavior, such that students in the RBI group were reported by their teachers to have lower levels of aggressive behavior than those in the control condition after accounting for pretest differences in aggressive behavior (see Table 3 for raw pretest means, Table 4 for adjusted posttest means, and Table 5 for MLM model results and ES). These results suggest that the mean score on aggression for students in the RBI group is lower than approximately 64% of students in the control group. Contrary to predictions, there was not an intervention effect for teachers' reports of students' prosocial behavior.

3.2.2. School connectedness
There were small (ES = 0.42) to moderate (ES = 0.61) condition effects on school liking and classroom identification, respectively. As expected, students in the RBI group reported liking school more and having greater feelings of classroom identification and inclusion than did students in the control condition at posttest, accounting for pretest differences (see Table 3, Table 4, Table 5). These results suggest that the mean scores on school liking and classroom identification for students in the RBI group are higher than approximately 66% and 73% of students in the control group, respectively.
3.2.3. Academic achievement
There was a moderate (ES = 0.79) effect of condition on overall grades. Students in the RBI group had higher overall grades as compared to students in the control condition at posttest after accounting for pretest differences (see Table 3, Table 4, Table 5). These results suggest that the mean score on overall grades for students in the RBI group is higher than approximately 78% of students in the control group, respectively.
3.3. Evaluation of RBI implementation data
Descriptive analyses were conducted to evaluate program fidelity, student responsiveness, satisfaction with RBI, and knowledge of RBI concepts.
3.3.1. Program fidelity and student responsiveness
Measures of fidelity (i.e., dosage, adherence, and implementation quality) and student responsiveness revealed that teachers implemented the program as intended and that students were attentive and engaged during activities. For instance, teachers' self-report data on dosage revealed that nine of 10 teachers reported completing 100% of the activities and one teacher reported completing 81% of the activities (i.e., all but the last unit of the curriculum). Additionally, observational data revealed high average ratings (using a 0–3 scale) of adherence (range: 1.63–3.0; M = 2.73; SD = 0.58), quality (range: 1.20–2.90; M = 2.10; SD = 0.81), and student responsiveness (range = 1.83–3.0; M = 2.83; SD = 0.52); however, there was variability observed between classrooms.
3.3.2. Program acceptability
RBI satisfaction questionnaires completed at the end of each unit revealed favorable reactions from teachers. Items were rated on a 0 (not at all) to 3 (a lot) scale with higher scores representing more favorable responses. The teacher satisfaction means for each of the five units were the following: Diversity and Inclusion (M = 2.65, SD = 0.23), Empathy and Critical Thinking (M = 2.38, SD = 0.31), Communication (M = 2.67, SD = 0.28), Problem Solving (M = 2.59, SD = 0.42), and Peer Relationships (M = 2.69, SD = 0.35). The mean satisfaction ratings from students suggested moderate satisfaction with the activities in each unit: Diversity and Inclusion (M = 2.07, SD = 0.57), Empathy and Critical Thinking (M = 2.04, SD = 0.59), Communication (M = 2.01, SD = 0.61), Problem Solving (M = 1.90, SD = 0.67), and Peer Relationships (M = 1.78, SD = 0.64).
3.3.3. Knowledge of RBI concepts
Student knowledge on unit concepts was moderate to high. Across the units, students answered 71% of questions about skills correctly. For the individual units, knowledge was high for the Communication (88%), Problem Solving (88%), and the Peer Relationships (84%) units, but relatively low for the more cognitively demanding activities within the Empathy and Critical Thinking (54%) unit.
4. Discussion
The present study was conducted to assess the impact of the RBI on indicators of social behaviors, school connectedness, and academic achievement. In all three areas, we found support that participating in the RBI was positively associated with fifth-grade students' school experiences and success. Controlling for pretest scores, cohort, and demographic variables, findings revealed that students who participated in the RBI were described by their teachers as less aggressive, personally reported liking school more, felt a greater sense of classroom identification and inclusion, and performed academically better than students who were in control classrooms. Further, our implementation data demonstrated that students and teachers responded positively to the activities.
4.1. Social behaviors
Results demonstrated that, relative to students in the control condition and accounting for pretest levels, teacher-reported aggressive behavior was lower for the RBI students at posttest. It is noteworthy that the difference in aggression between control and intervention groups was small (ES = − 0.34), which is likely due to the overall low levels of aggression observed in both groups. Nonetheless, the small effect on aggression may have been partly due to an increase in peer liking and acceptance that resulted from students' participation in the RBI. For instance, the RBI provides ongoing opportunities for students to learn and practice positive communication and problem solving skills that may have enhanced children's ability to use non-aggressive strategies to address socially challenging situations. By promoting the norm of classroom inclusion, it is also possible that the RBI fostered the development of positive affiliations between socially central children and children with characteristics (e.g., internalizing problems, physical weakness, friendlessness) that would otherwise render them vulnerable or easy marks for peer aggression (e.g., Hodges and Perry, 1999, Veenstra et al., 2007). Regardless of the exact mechanism, the fact that we found an effect for teacher-reported aggression is notable given that the RBI does not specifically target aggressive behaviors. Such findings are consistent, however, with other research suggesting that the promotion of positive interpersonal behavior may have the potential to counteract aggressive behavior and victimization (Caprara et al., 2014) and redirect negative trajectories of functioning and adjustment (Schwartz et al., 2010).
Given that the RBI appears to have a positive impact on teachers' reports of students' aggressive behavior, we were surprised that students in the RBI group did not outscore control students on posttest measures of teacher-reported prosocial behavior. One possible reason for this null finding is that students in our sample were already exhibiting relatively high levels of prosocial behavior; therefore, there was not much room for improvement in our measure of prosociality. Moreover, it is probable that teachers are more likely to notice changes in aggressive behaviors compared to changes in prosocial behaviors. Aggressive behaviors, such as teasing, hitting, and kicking, require teachers to intervene and are very disruptive to classroom instruction. Consequently, decreases in aggressive behaviors are likely to be quite noticeable to teachers. In contrast, prosocial behaviors (e.g., helping, cooperation) do not require teachers' attention and, therefore, teachers might be less likely to recognize increases in these behaviors. Taken together, future research evaluating the effectiveness of RBI should incorporate multiple measurement methods (e.g., teacher-report, peer-report, observational ratings) and target classrooms with lower reported levels of prosocial behavior to provide a more comprehensive and sensitive assessment of prosocial behavior change.
4.2. School connectedness
As expected, findings revealed significant effects on our two indicators of school connectedness: school liking and classroom identification and inclusion. Namely, students participating in the RBI reported liking school more and feeling a greater sense of belonging and inclusion in their classrooms compared to students in control classrooms. Key features of the RBI are potentially responsible for the observed effects on school connectedness. First, based on intergroup contact theory (Allport, 1954) and the common ingroup identity model (Gaertner & Dovidio, 2000), an essential feature of the RBI was to provide students with opportunities to get to know each other, form a common identity, and to experience, learn, and practice concepts in diverse groupings. Thus, when intergroup contact and cohesion is encouraged, students appear to feel a greater sense of belonging and connection to their classroom. This perspective is supported by research showing that engaging in intergroup interactions and friendships is positively related to a sense of safety and belongingness in school (Graham, Munniksma, & Juvonen, 2014). Another important feature of the RBI is that within these diverse groupings, students are taught key relationship skills (e.g., communication, problem solving) that enable them to have peer interactions that are successful. Thus, it seems reasonable to expect that when students feel efficacious in their peer interactions and are supported in their efforts to get to know each other and negotiate conflicts, their sense of classroom community is enhanced. These results are encouraging because they suggest that the RBI successfully promoted factors in the classroom essential for creating a positive classroom context, including a classroom climate where students feel supported, included, and valued. This is especially important in light of the growing body of evidence attesting to the role that school climate plays in students' social, emotional, and academic success (e.g., Thapa, Cohen, Guffey, & Higgins-D'Alessandro, 2013).
4.3. Academic achievement
As expected, students in the RBI condition earned higher overall grades than students in the control condition. Although the RBI was not designed to directly enhance students' learning skills, such findings highlight the link between positive social classroom climates and scholastic performance (Caprara et al., 2000, Ryan and Ladd, 2012). The fact that peers are the same age, often possess similar interests and skills, and spend a good deal of time with one another implies that they are uniquely poised to influence one another's learning outcomes (Hymel, Comfort, Schonert-Reichl, & McDougall, 1996). For example, it has been proposed that children's relationships, including friendships, peer rejection/acceptance, and peer victimization, have the potential to facilitate or inhibit classroom participation, engagement, and overall academic success (Ladd et al., 2012). Support for this hypothesis comes from research that indicates that high levels of perceived instrumental and emotional support from peers, including friends, promote students' classroom participation and engagement (Ladd et al., 2012). In contrast, peer rejection has been found to restrict rejected children's opportunities to contribute to and benefit from classroom activities, such as those that are academically oriented (Buhs, Ladd, & Herald, 2006). The RBI's focus on the development of positive peer relations may have facilitated increases in students' classroom participation and engagement, which, in turn, may have accounted for the positive academic outcome reported here.
Additionally, it also may be the case that in the RBI classrooms, classroom behavior was more positive, thereby allowing teachers to spend more time on instruction and less time on behavior management. The more regulated and positive classroom climate evident in RBI classrooms provides a more optimal context for learning that contributes to improved grades. More research is needed to identify the specific mechanisms related to the effects of the RBI on students' academic performance and to explore the processes that accounted for this finding. Until then, the effects of the RBI on academic performance should be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, the results are promising and further support the fact that SEL-type programs can enhance academic achievement.
4.4. Implementation data
Monitoring and verifying program implementation is essential to understanding if programs are actually delivered as intended and to identify the core components of the program needed to achieve results (e.g., Berkel et al., 2011, Carroll et al., 2007, Dane and Schneider, 1998). This was especially important in the present study, as this was the first attempt to evaluate the efficacy of the RBI. Given that the time required to implement a program is among the leading reasons teachers cite in deciding to implement or not implement an intervention (Ruef, Higgins, Glaeser, & Patnode, 1998), it was also critical to assess if the investment of time in the RBI was perceived to be worthwhile by teachers and students.
Our findings suggest that teachers were generally able to implement the RBI as intended. Regarding dosage, all but one teacher implemented 100% of the activities. This demonstrates that the majority of teachers were committed to the program and were able to “fit in” activity implementation within the time limitations of the school day. Further, our observational findings revealed high average ratings of adherence and quality: teachers generally followed the guidelines for the script, showed enthusiasm when implementing the program, and demonstrated an adequate understanding of the program goals and rationale. It is important to note, however, that there was variability between teachers in their level of fidelity, which suggests that some teachers followed the RBI procedures more closely than other teachers. The variance observed in fidelity underscores the importance of conducting future research to examine why some teachers implement the RBI more effectively than other teachers and whether level of fidelity explains variance in child-level outcome variables (Domitrovich and Greenberg, 2000, Reyes et al., 2012).
Importantly, teachers and students generally reported positive attitudes about the program. Teachers' average satisfaction ratings for the units ranged between “somewhat” to “a lot,” which suggests that they had high program “buy-in” and that they thought that the implementation of the RBI was feasible. Observational data of students' responsiveness suggested that students were focused and engaged during activities and their self-reported satisfaction indicated moderate levels of program acceptability (i.e., mean ratings across all five units suggested students were “somewhat” satisfied). Future research should examine students' perceptions of the RBI more closely to examine whether program revisions are needed to bolster students' acceptability of the program.
A unique feature of this study was that, in addition to assessing fidelity and participant responsiveness, we also tracked fifth graders' comprehension of core program concepts. Our findings demonstrate that students evidenced moderate to high knowledge of RBI concepts. This is especially encouraging because many of the quiz questions were challenging; they were open-ended and required students to recall and/or apply key terms and concepts. It is noteworthy that students had the most difficulty with the Empathy and Critical Thinking Unit Quiz (i.e., mean score was 54%). Compared to the other units, the Empathy and Critical Thinking Unit presents concepts that are likely more challenging and novel to students (e.g., identifying the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors versus identifying important friendship characteristics in the Peer Relationships Unit); thus, fifth-graders might need additional exposure to these concepts to demonstrate greater fluency. In addition, the questions on the Empathy and Critical Thinking Unit quiz relied mostly on recall questions (e.g., name 3 of the 5 major problems associated with stereotyping), whereas the other unit quizzes included more matching and true/false items (e.g., true or false: spreading rumors is one example of bullying).
4.5. Limitations and future directions
Although this evaluation of the efficacy of the RBI revealed encouraging findings, the present study has some limitations. First, instead of randomly assigning schools to condition, we utilized a quasi-experimental nonequivalent comparison group design by attempting to match intervention and control schools on key demographic variables. Despite our matching efforts, our intervention and control schools differed on demographic and outcome variables at our pretest assessment. To address this selection bias, in all analyses, we statistically controlled for these differences; however, it is still possible that pre-existing differences between intervention and control schools contributed to the significant findings because it is possible that we did not measure all of the potential covariates. Furthermore, in using this analytic method, measurement error may have contributed to an attenuation of effects; thus, we view our results as reflecting a conservative test of the intervention effects. Despite the limitations of this design, we were able to implement a test of our intervention effects within the context of intact groups (i.e., classrooms) that kept the students in their natural school settings, providing our study a relatively high degree of external validity. To strengthen our confidence in the efficacy of the RBI, future researchers will need to implement a randomized control trial design.
Related to the issue of non-randomization is the concern that schools were initially selected based on their willingness to implement the intervention, as well as receiving financial compensation for implementing the RBI. It is possible that the high motivation of the teachers who implemented the RBI contributed to the success of the program, and/or that teachers who expressed interest in and got paid for implementing an SEL-type program may be implementing practices independent of the RBI that led to the desired effects. It is noteworthy that the schools that were contacted to be in our control group expressed an interest in implementing the RBI when the study was described to them; however, it is unclear whether they would have successfully implemented the program if given the opportunity. It is also notable that the median income of the sample in the present study was high; therefore, the findings reported here may not generalize to children who are not from high SES backgrounds and who attend schools where factors such as a lack of resources and low teacher buy-in might interfere with the effective implementation of interventions.
Another limitation is that we utilized a non-treatment “education-as-usual” control group and did not track the types of interventions or services that may have been implemented in the control classrooms. Given that our study is primarily based on student- and teacher-reported data, it is possible that social desirability and/or placebo effects influenced participants' responses. In particular, differences between RBI versus control teachers' reports of changes in aggressive behavior may have been influenced by RBI teachers' expectations for improvement. To address this issue in future research, it will be important to utilize an “active control group” by implementing a comparison intervention in control classrooms and assessing whether expectations for improvement are similar in the control and RBI intervention programs. Further, it will be important in future studies to use teacher-reported and observational measures of “program differentiation” (Carroll et al., 2007) to examine whether RBI and control teachers do, in fact, employ different classroom practices. Collecting this type of data would not only provide compelling evidence that the RBI classrooms are unique in their use of specific program practices, but it would also assist us with identifying the essential elements of the RBI that are needed to attain desired benefits.
There are also noteworthy limitations with the observational procedures that were employed to assess fidelity and student responsiveness. First, teachers were only observed implementing a small subset of activities throughout the year. It is possible that teachers displayed higher levels of fidelity when they were being videotaped compared to the sessions that we did not observe; therefore, our findings might overestimate implementation quality and adherence. Second, our observational implementation measure was developed specifically for the present study and has not been previously validated. Although we based our observational measure on existing measures and current recommendations for evaluating implementation (e.g., Berkel et al., 2011, Century et al., 2010, Dunesbury et al., 2005, Ennett et al., 2011), future work is needed to validate and improve the internal consistency of the scales.
A final limitation to consider is the nature of the outcome measures that were included in the present study. The relational and contextual goals of the RBI are to promote positive peer relationships and inclusive school environments. Whereas our findings suggest that the RBI had an impact on some of these outcomes, we only measured these variables using teacher- and self-report data. It is also noteworthy that the RBI was specifically designed to impact peer relationships; however, our outcome measures were limited to behaviorally-oriented social outcomes rather than relationally-oriented outcomes such as friendship ties and peer acceptance. Moreover, in the present study, we did not evaluate the mediating processes, such as improved intergroup attitudes and communication skills or enhanced classroom management, which are hypothesized to account for our intended outcomes. Taken together, future research evaluating the RBI should include peer-reports as well as observational and attitudinal measurements to assess mediating processes and peer relationships and to evaluate whether students are putting their new knowledge and skills into practice during actual interactions with their peers.
4.6. Conclusions
The present study represents a first effort at evaluating a theoretically- and empirically- based intervention designed to promote positive peer relationships and an inclusive and supportive learning climate in classrooms. Despite limitations, the findings of this evaluation are compelling and demonstrate the potential of the RBI to have positive effects in the classroom. Our initial results revealed that fifth-grade students exposed to the RBI reported that they had more positive learning environments and evidenced stronger academic success than fifth-graders who did not participate in the RBI. Moreover, teachers and students responded positively to the program and, overall, teachers implemented the RBI with high levels of fidelity. Taken together, this study illustrates that the RBI may be an effective intervention tool for targeting key peer relational processes essential for students' social and academic success.
