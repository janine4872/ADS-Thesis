Abstract
Social-emotional wellbeing is known to contribute to children’s learning and general health. As a national priority in the United States, schools are called upon to foster social-emotional health in children as part of healthy child development (Durlack, Weissberg, Dymnick, Taylor, & Schellinger. 2011). The study reports the implementation and findings of an empirically supported classroom-based social-emotional learning (SEL) curriculum in second grade students in a suburban South New Jersey school district. Using a two-group non-equivalent design, it is hypothesized that students who are taught of the SEL lessons will show significant improvement in their social-emotional competence in both school and home environments.

The Problem
According to John Santrock (2015), many researchers consider the development
of social-emotional skills to be fundamental to an individual’s success in the world.
Firstly, with the changes in the structure of families and society, there is rising concern
that children are not being taught the emotional skills that enable them to cope properly
with the challenges in everyday life. In fact, approximately 12-22% of students younger
than eighteen experience mental health problems severe enough to need mental health
services (Whitcomb & Parisi-Damico, 2016). According to the Report of the Surgeon
General’s Conference on Children’s Mental Health, “mental health is a critical
component of children’s learning and general health. Fostering social and emotional
health in children as part of healthy child development must therefore be a national
priority (Durlack, Weissberg, Dymnick, Taylor, & Schellinger. 2011).” The Institute of
Medicine (2009) provides solidarity, stating that the proper development and support of
social-emotional competencies, self-efficacy, and social inclusion can serve as both
prevention strategy and treatment method for mental, emotional, and behavioral
disorders.
Secondly, it is noted that students’ understanding of their emotions is linked to
their prosocial behaviors (Santrock, 2015). Prosocial behaviors play a strong role in the
success of relationships with others, which includes but is not limited to, peers, teachers,
parents, and siblings. Students who are more negative, are more likely to be rejected by
their peers (Santrock, 2015). Students who are less understanding and have less control
over their emotions will struggle with student-teacher relationships and parent-child

relationships, due to impulsiveness to act upon emotions, frustration, and behavioral
outbursts. These tensions will impact their self-esteem and motivation to succeed. During
the primary grade levels children are experiencing emotions in a new capacity, and it is
important that they learn productive ways to express their emotions (Whitcomb & ParisiDamico, 2016). For example, it is no longer acceptable for students to have tempertantrums if they are angry because a tantrum is disruptive to the classroom. Students need
to be taught the skills to handle their emotions in a socially acceptable manner. Ronen
Habib (2015) states in TEDx Gunn High School, “You know, we assume that second
graders don’t know how to multiply, how to divide, and how to read. And that’s why we
teach it to them— as we should. But why do we assume that second graders know how to
self-regulate, self-manage, or be empathic?”
Developmental research claims that interventions targeting social-emotional
development help increase students’ academic and social successes. Social-emotional
intelligence is associated with mental well-being, positive academic progress (Durlak et
al. 2011), positive employment relationships, prosocial behaviors, good problem-solving
skills, and self-motivation (Zins & Elias, 2006).
Social-emotional learning (SEL) is defined as “the process of acquiring and
effectively applying the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to recognize and
manage emotions; developing caring and concern for others; making responsible
decisions; establishing positive relationships; and handling challenging situations capably
(Zins & Elias, 2006).” There are many educators, parents, and specialists supporting the
requirement of SEL instruction in schools because it helps decrease and prevent
emotional-behavioral outbursts and problems (Caldarella, Christensen, Kramer, &

Kronmiller, 2009). Though it is not currently a Common Core requirement (Habib,
2015), there are schools that have implemented SEL programs to support the
development of social and emotional skills in their students. Successful SEL programs in
schools have shown a multitude of benefits. With more empirical research, it is becoming
recognizable that social-emotional skills are just as important as academics because not
all skills are innate- they are also taught. A classroom provides the structure and routine
that can make social-emotional learning effective in students’ everyday lives.
SEL programs provide systematic classroom instruction and educator training
(Payton et al., 2000). They also give us the opportunity to investigate how social
emotional intelligence is related to emotion regulation, behavior control, peer
interactions, academic performance, and cognitive development. SEL curriculums
implemented in school environments have shown positive outcomes.
In this study the curriculum implemented in this research study is a part of Strong
Kids by Kenneth Merrell, Ph.D., developed at the University of Oregon. Strong Start, the
early education program, consists of two programs: Children ages 3-5 and Grades K-2
(Oregon Resiliency Project). For this research Strong Start—Grade K-2 was implemented
in a second grade classroom. Research on Strong Start—Grades K-2 has been completed
on both kindergarten (Kramer et al., 2010) and second grade students (Caldarella et al.,
2009). In both studies prosocial behaviors and internalized behaviors of the children in
their class were assessed through the teacher rating. Kramer et al. (2000), also had
parents complete assessments for their kindergarten students who participated in the
Strong Start curriculum. Parents rated their students’ an increase in prosocial behaviors,
but did not rate a significant decrease for internalized behaviors, like the kindergarten
