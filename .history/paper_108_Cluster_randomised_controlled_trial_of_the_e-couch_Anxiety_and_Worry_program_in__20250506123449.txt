Abstract
Background
Anxiety is a common mental health problem in youth. The current study aimed to test the effectiveness of an online self-directed anxiety prevention program in a school-based sample and to compare two methods of implementing an anxiety program in schools.
Methods
A three-arm cluster stratified randomised controlled trial was conducted with 30 Australian schools. Each school was randomly assigned to receive: (1) externally-supported intervention, (2) teacher-supported intervention, or (3) wait-list control. All consenting students (N=1767) were invited to complete pre-intervention, post-intervention, 6- and 12-month follow-up questionnaires measuring generalised anxiety, social anxiety, anxiety sensitivity, depressive symptoms and mental wellbeing. Intervention participants completed the e-couch Anxiety and Worry program over 6 weeks.
Results
At post-intervention, 6- and 12-month follow-up no significant differences were observed between the intervention and control conditions for generalised anxiety (Cohen's d=−0.14 to 0.15), social anxiety (d=0.04–0.23), anxiety sensitivity (d=−0.07 to 0.07), depressive symptoms (d=−0.05 to 0.04) or mental wellbeing (d=−0.06 to −0.30).
Limitations
The current study only included self-report measures that may have been influenced by situational factors or biases.
Conclusions
The e-couch Anxiety and Worry program did not have a significant positive effect on participant mental health or wellbeing. The addition of a mental health education officer to support classroom teachers in the delivery of the program also had no effect on intervention outcomes. Future prevention research should look to develop briefer and more interactive interventions that are more engaging for youth.

1. Introduction
Anxiety is one of the most common mental health problems in young people (Rickwood et al., 2014), with the one-year prevalence rate reported to be between 7% and 25% (Beesdo et al., 2009, Kessler et al., 2012). The psychosocial effect of anxiety on a young person's life can be substantial (Donovan and Spence, 2000) and often precedes the development of depression (Essau, 2008, Flannery-Schroeder, 2006). Due to the high prevalence and burden associated with anxiety disorders, the prevention of anxiety in young people has become a focus for research and intervention, including the development of school-based prevention programs (Neil and Christensen, 2009). These programs are typically designed to prevent and reduce symptoms of anxiety, and are delivered to a population that has traditionally had low levels of disorder identification (Barrett and Pahl, 2006, Wells et al., 2001) and help-seeking behaviour (Essau, 2005, Merikangas et al., 2011, Slade et al., 2009).
A comprehensive review of anxiety prevention programs in schools identified 27 trials of 20 individual programs, which were predominantly targeted at adolescents (59%), were aimed at reducing or preventing symptoms of non-specific anxiety (67%), and were based on cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT; Neil and Christensen, 2009). Of these programs, over three-quarters were effective at post-intervention and/or follow-up, with effect sizes ranging from 0.11 to 1.37 (Neil and Christensen, 2009). Despite the effectiveness of a number of school-based anxiety prevention programs, few are routinely delivered in schools. Reasons for this are varied but the reluctance of teachers to deliver these programs due to a lack of knowledge or training in mental health appears to be a key factor (Spence et al., 2005), as well as concerns surrounding student referral for further assistance and care. Given these concerns, it is important to develop appropriate methods of delivering anxiety prevention programs in schools, to ensure that schools can continue to support the mental health needs of their students.
The aim of the current trial, therefore, was two-fold. The first aim was to test the effectiveness of an online universal anxiety program in schools relative to a wait-list control condition. The delivery of an online intervention in schools has the potential to overcome some of the problems traditionally associated with face-to-face school-based programs by offering a self-directed program that requires little teacher training or knowledge. The current study examined the effectiveness of the e-couch Anxiety and Worry program, an online intervention for generalised anxiety (Calear et al., 2013). A recent small pilot prevention trial of this intervention conducted with 225 adolescents (71% female, 13–17 years [M=15.0, SD=1.08]) from three schools found small effects for anxiety sensitivity at post-intervention (Cohen's d=0.19) and mental wellbeing at post-intervention (d=0.17) and 3-month follow-up (d=0.30). Given the small sample size, these effects were not statistically significant. Nevertheless, the size of the effects obtained were comparable to other effective online universal school-based interventions for anxiety, such as MoodGYM (d=0.15–0.25; Calear et al., 2009) and This Way Up (d=0.18–0.29; Wong et al., 2014). The MoodGYM trial evaluated the effectiveness of an online CBT intervention for depression and anxiety in 30 schools (N=1477) across Australia, while the two This Way Up anxiety and depression CBT-based programs were evaluated in 12 schools (N=976) across Australia.
The current trial evaluated the effectiveness of the e-couch Anxiety and Worry program as a universal preventive intervention in a larger and more representative sample of high school students. The trial was adequately powered to detect small to moderate intervention effects and was one of the first trials to evaluate a program specifically targeted to generalised anxiety. It was hypothesised that, compared to the wait-list control condition, participation in the e-couch Anxiety and Worry program would be associated with significant decreases in anxiety and depressive symptoms, and higher levels of mental wellbeing, at post-intervention, 6- and 12-month follow-up.
The second aim of the current trial was to determine whether an enhanced version of program delivery (e-GAD health service method), which incorporated access to a mental health service provider, would result in superior outcomes relative to the standard teacher administered intervention (e-GAD school method). There is some evidence in the adult e-health literature that guidance can increase intervention effects (Baumeister et al., 2014), regardless of the clinical expertise of the guide (Titov et al., 2010). The e-GAD health service method involved education officers from local headspace centres supporting and assisting classroom teachers in the administration of the program. headspace is an Australian youth mental health foundation that provides mental health services and support for young people aged 12–24 years (Rickwood et al., 2014). The enhanced version of the program tested whether there was an added benefit to having the intervention supported and guided by a mental health service provider. Such providers tend to possess greater knowledge of mental health problems than classroom teachers, and are able to provide participants with direct access to face-to-face mental health services. A direct comparison of two delivery methods in schools has not previously been undertaken. It was hypothesised that the positive effect of the e-couch Anxiety and Worry program on anxiety, depressive symptoms and mental wellbeing would be greater in the guided e-GAD health service method than in the e-GAD school method. It was further hypothesised that adherence in the e-GAD health service method condition would be higher than in the e-GAD school method condition.
2. Methods
2.1. Participants
Thirty-two schools from across Australia were recruited to participate in the Y-Worri trial. Schools were recruited according to the location of six participating headspace centres. A three-arm cluster stratified randomised controlled trial (RCT) design was employed in the current study. Each participating school (cluster) was randomly allocated to one of three conditions: e-GAD school method, e-GAD health service method, or wait-list control, according to headspace centre location. Cluster randomisation was undertaken in the current study for administrative convenience, to avoid wait-list control condition contamination, and for the ecological validity of providing the intervention at the cluster level (Donner and Klar, 2000, Puffer et al., 2005). An independent statistician randomly allocated schools within each headspace centre (stratum) to the trial conditions using a computerised random number generator. The identity of schools was concealed from the statistician during this process. Two schools, allocated to the e-GAD school method condition, dropped out of the study after randomisation but before the commencement of the trial due to internal school difficulties. These schools were not replaced.
A total of 1767 students (37.2% male, 62.8% female) consented to participate in the trial. Participant age ranged from 12 to 18 years, with a mean age of 14.83 years (SD=0.97). Just under half (45%) of the participants were in Year 9 (14–15 years) at school, while 33% were in Year 10 (15–16 years), 22% were in Year 11 (16–17 years) and <1% were in Year 12 (17–18 years). Approximately 7% indicated that they lived on a farm or rural property, and 88% reported English as their first language. Of those students who reported a language other than English as their first language, 38% spoke Chinese, 10% spoke Vietnamese, and 7% and 3% spoke Indian and Arabic respectively. The vast majority of participants (76%) reported living with both parents, while 28% of participants stated they had a prior history of anxiety.
Fig. 1 presents the recruitment and retention of participants in the trial. Of the 1767 participants recruited to the trial, 427 participants (43.6% male, 56.4% female) from eight schools were allocated to the e-GAD school method condition (4 to 271 students per school; Median=27). The mean age of participants in this condition was 15.07 years (SD=1.15). A total of 562 participants (29.2% male, 70.8% female) from 11 schools were randomly assigned to the e-GAD health service method condition (14 to 139 students per school; Median=47). The mean age of participants in this condition was 14.79 years (SD=0.78). Finally, 778 participants (39.6% male, 60.4% female) from 11 schools comprised the wait-list control condition (8 to 417 students per school; Median=28), with participants in this condition reporting a mean age of 14.73 years (SD=0.97). The differing number of participants in each condition was due to two schools dropping out of the e-GAD health condition prior to the commencement of the trial and variability in the number of students who were invited by each school to participate in the trial.

2.2. Measures
2.2.1. Generalised anxiety
Generalised anxiety was measured using the generalised anxiety sub-scale of the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS; Spence, 1998) and the GAD-7 (Spitzer et al., 2006). The generalised anxiety sub-scale of the SCAS is a 6-item self-report measure. Total scale scores can range from 0 to 18, with higher scores reflecting greater levels of generalised anxiety. Internal consistency was high in the current study (Cronbach α=.82). The GAD-7 is a 7-item self-report measure of generalised anxiety symptoms, with total scale scores ranging from 0 to 21. Higher scores indicate greater levels of generalised anxiety symptoms. The GAD-7 demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach α=.88). A clinical cut-off of ≥10 on the GAD-7 (Spitzer et al., 2006) was used to identify participants with elevated levels of generalised anxiety.
2.2.2. Social anxiety
The 22-item self-report Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents (SAS-A; La Greca, 1998) was used to assess symptoms of social anxiety. The SAS-A comprises 18 items that measure a respondent's subjective experience of social anxiety, and four filler items. Total scale scores can range from 18 to 90, with higher SAS-A scores reflecting greater levels of social anxiety. The internal consistency of the SAS-A was high (Cronbach α=.92) in the current study.
2.2.3. Anxiety sensitivity
The Childhood Anxiety Sensitivity Index (CASI; Silverman et al., 1991) was used to assess anxiety sensitivity, which is associated with panic attacks and panic disorder. This 18-item self-report scale measures the extent to which the respondent believes that the experience of anxiety will result in negative consequences. Total scale scores can range from 18 to 54, with higher scores associated with greater anxiety sensitivity. The CASI exhibited high internal consistency (Cronbach α=.90) in the current study.
2.2.4. Depressive symptoms
The 20-item self-report Centre for Epidemiological Studies – Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977) was used to assesses the frequency of depressive symptoms over the past 7 days. Total scale scores can range from 0 to 60, with higher scores associated with greater levels of depressive symptoms. Good internal consistency (Cronbach α=.79) was obtained in the current study.
2.2.5. Mental wellbeing.
The 14-item self-report Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS; Tennant et al., 2007) was used in the current study to assess positive mental health. Total scale scores can range from 14 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater levels of mental wellbeing. The WEMWBS exhibited high internal consistency (Cronbach α=.93) in the current study.
2.2.6. Adherence and attendance.
The e-couch Anxiety and Worry program automatically recorded the commencement and completion of each section of the intervention (e.g., psychoeducation, CBT toolkit, Relaxation Toolkit). The number of sections completed can range from 0 to 6, corresponding with each week of the intervention.
2.3. Procedure
The trial was registered as ACTRN12610001103055. Ethical approval for the current study was obtained from the Australian National University Human Research Ethics Committee (protocol 2010/550), as well as the state and Catholic education departments responsible for the schools involved in the study. Information and consent forms containing details of the trial were distributed to all students and their parent/guardian in participating schools, with written informed consent required from both for the completion of study questionnaires. Approximately 55% of eligible students and their parents consented to participate in the trial.
The classroom teachers and headspace education officers at each school were provided with a Y-Worri trial manual, which contained detailed instructions on how to deliver the study questionnaires and how to support students in the completion of the e-couch Anxiety and Worry program. No other training was required given the self-directed nature of the intervention. All consenting students were invited to complete a pre-intervention, post-intervention, 6- and 12-month follow-up questionnaire. Questionnaires were administered by the classroom teacher (either online via a secure web-based questionnaire or by paper and pencil). These took students approximately 20–30 min to complete.
Following the pre-intervention questionnaire, students in the intervention conditions completed the e-couch Anxiety and Worry program (www.ecouch.anu.edu.au) during one class period (30–40 min) per week for six weeks. Classroom teachers in the e-GAD school method condition supervised students' completion of the e-couch Anxiety and Worry program, with no direct teaching, while teachers in the e-GAD health service method condition also received assistance and support from a headspace education officer. The role of headspace education officers was to respond to student questions about the intervention and to offer referral pathways to students if they had additional mental health concerns.
During the intervention phase of the trial, schools in the wait-list control condition continued usual classes and were offered the intervention at the conclusion of the trial (after the 12-month follow-up questionnaire). None of the wait-list control condition schools reported completing any mental health related programs during the intervention phase of the trial. All participants reporting elevated levels of anxiety and/or depression in trial questionnaires, regardless of their trial condition (intervention or control), were referred to the school counsellor in accordance with usual school procedures. Students were also provided with help-seeking contacts (e.g., phone helpline numbers) throughout the trial. Due to confidentiality and the multiple occasions at which a participant could have been referred onto further care in the current trial (e.g., self-referral, elevated questionnaire scores), it was not possible to calculate the total number of referrals made. Further details on the trial methods can be found in the study protocol (Calear et al., 2013).
2.4. Intervention
The e-couch Anxiety and Worry program (www.ecouch.anu.edu.au) was delivered over six 30–40 min sessions and consists of two core sections: psychoeducation and three evidence-based toolkits for anxiety. The psychoeducation section was presented over the first two sessions and includes information on generalised anxiety signs and symptoms, risk factors, consequences, and the medical, psychological and lifestyle treatments available. The three toolkits contained in the e-couch Anxiety and Worry program cover CBT, relaxation and physical activity. The CBT toolkit was delivered over sessions three and four, and focuses on the cognitive aspects of worry and how to address them. The relaxation toolkit was presented in the fifth session and introduces the user to the potential benefits of relaxation, with two relaxation exercises. The physical activity toolkit was delivered in the sixth and final session, and teaches users about the benefits of being physically active and identifies strategies for increasing or maintaining their current level of physical activity based on stages of change theory. All sessions were presented consecutively and include practice and homework exercises.
2.5. Statistical analysis
2.5.1. Power analyses.
Power calculations were conducted on the assumption that average class sizes would be 25 students, with a total of 750 students from 30 schools if at least one class per school was recruited. Based on a previous school-based trial (Calear et al., 2009), an intraclass correlation (ICC) of.02 and non-participation rate of 30% was expected, resulting in data being available from 525 students. The ICC of .02 led to a design effect of 1.48 and an effective sample size of 354. Assuming a correlation between measurements over time of .5, two-tailed tests and alpha of .05, the trial was expected to have 80% power to detect group differences down to .30 standard deviations.
2.5.2. Pre-intervention and missingness comparisons.
Sample characteristics were compared across conditions at pre-intervention using χ2 tests for categorical variables and F tests from one-way ANOVA for continuous variables. Similar analyses were also conducted to compare participants who did not complete assessments with those who did, to identify correlates of attrition.
2.5.3. Primary and secondary outcome analyses.
Visual inspection of the data was carried out to identify potential outliers at each time-point, as well as outlying change over time. No substantial or influential outliers were identified. The primary effectiveness analyses were undertaken on an intent-to-treat (ITT) basis. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRM; Verbeke and Molenberghs, 2000) were used to include all available data, including that from participants who subsequently withdrew from the trial. This approach yields unbiased estimates of intervention effects under the assumption that data are missing at random (MAR). An unstructured covariance matrix was assumed and degrees of freedom were estimated using Satterthwaite's correction. A random effect of school was estimated within each model, to account for clustering within schools. The raw residuals of each model were examined with normal probability plots and were found to be within acceptable limits. Planned preventative and clinical sub-sample analyses (Calear et al., 2013) were also undertaken.
The ICC was calculated by dividing the between classes variance by the sum of the between classes variance and the within-classes variance under this model (Donner and Klar, 2000). The test of the significance of the class effect is equivalent to testing whether the ICC is different to zero. ICCs of between 0.001 and 0.05 were obtained for the models in the current study. This indicates that approximately 0.1% to 5% of the variance in individuals' scores could be explained by between-classes effects.
Cohen's d between group effect sizes were calculated using observed mean loss/gain scores from pre-intervention to post-intervention and from pre-intervention to 6- and 12-month follow-up. Positive effect sizes are indicative of changes in favour of the intervention condition.
2.5.4. Clinical caseness analyses
A mixed effects logit analysis was also conducted using the xtlogit procedure to determine whether there was a significant change in the proportion of participants in the intervention and wait-list control conditions who met criteria for clinical caseness (GAD-7≥10) from pre- to post-intervention, 6- and 12-month follow-up. All analyses were conducted in SPSS v20 (IBM Corp, Chicago IL) or Stata v10.
3. Results
3.1. Missing data at post-intervention and follow-up
A CONSORT flowchart of participant progression through the study is provided in Fig. 1. Rates of attrition were significantly different across all groups at each time point, with greatest attrition in the e-GAD school method condition at post-intervention and the wait-list control condition at both follow-up assessments. At all time-points, attrition was significantly associated with being in a later year of school (i.e., year 11 or 12), having a previous history of anxiety, and reporting higher levels of generalised anxiety at pre-intervention (as measured by the GAD-7). At post-intervention, speaking a language other than English (LOTE) was also a significant predictor of attrition, while at 6-month follow-up being male, older, and reporting lower levels of social anxiety at pre-intervention were significantly associated with attrition. At 12-month follow-up attrition was significantly associated with being male, older, speaking a LOTE, and reporting lower levels of mental wellbeing at pre-intervention.
3.2. Pre-intervention comparisons
Sample characteristics for each condition at pre-intervention are provided in Table 1. There were a number of differences between conditions at pre-intervention. Participants from e-GAD health service method condition schools were significantly more likely than participants in the other conditions to: complete paper-based surveys, be female, be in Year 10, be living in a rural area, and speak a language other than English (LOTE) at home. Participants in e-GAD school method condition schools were significantly more likely than participants in the other conditions to: report previous anxiety, be older, and have higher GAD-7 scores. No group differences were observed on the basis of indigenous background, living situation, or pre-intervention scores on the SCAS-GAD, SAS-A, CASI, CES-D or WEMWBS.

3.3. Primary and secondary outcomes
The outcomes of the trial are summarized in Table 2, Table 3. Table 2 displays the estimated marginal means (and standard errors) for each condition at each time-point, with F tests for the condition by time interaction, from the MMRM analyses for each of the six outcomes examined. Table 3 presents the between group effect sizes at each time-point. A significant interaction effect indicates differential change in the outcome between conditions. Only the WEMWBS outcome showed a significant interaction. A priori paired comparisons showed that the outcome favoured the wait-list control condition, with the e-GAD school method condition having significantly greater reductions in well-being at post-intervention (t [897.1]=−2.1, p=0.035) and 6-month follow-up (t [1158.7]=−4.2, p<0.001) than the wait-list control condition, and the e-GAD health service method condition also having significantly greater reductions in well-being at the 6-month follow-up (but not post-intervention) relative to the wait-list control condition (t [1124.5]=−3.3, p=0.001). Although there were no significant omnibus interaction effects between condition and time for any other outcomes, significant effects for social anxiety (t [1121.9]=−2.2, p=0.03) and generalised anxiety (t [950.6]=2.4, p=0.02) were observed between the e-GAD health service method and the wait-list control conditions at 6-month follow-up. There was no effect of age, gender, mode of survey administration, LOTE, pre-intervention GAD-7 symptom level (preventative and clinical sub-sample analyses) or number of intervention sessions completed on outcomes.

3.4. Clinical caseness
At baseline, 13.8% of all participants met clinical levels of generalised anxiety symptoms (GAD-7≥10), remaining fairly stable throughout the study (14.4% post-test, 14.0% 6 months, 17.0% 12 months). There were no significant condition by time interactions in clinical caseness based on mixed effects logit analysis.
3.5. Adherence to the intervention
Within the e-GAD school method condition, 78% of participants completed the first two weeks of the e-couch Anxiety and Worry program, while 43% completed at least four weeks of the program and 36% completed all six weeks of the intervention. In the e-GAD health service method, 87% of participants completed the first two weeks of the intervention, 65% completed at least four weeks of the e-couch Anxiety and Worry program and 50% completed all six weeks, with significantly greater program completion than the e-GAD school method (χ2 [1]=18.8, p<0.001).
4. Discussion
There was no evidence for the effectiveness of the e-couch Anxiety and Worry program, in reducing symptoms of generalised anxiety, social anxiety, anxiety sensitivity, or depression, regardless of method of delivery. The lack of effects was also found irrespective of age, gender, mode of survey administration, LOTE, pre-intervention anxiety symptoms or number of intervention sessions completed.
At the 6-month follow-up, a small significant difference was observed between the e-GAD health service method condition and the wait-list control condition for social anxiety (d=0.23) and generalised anxiety, as measured by the GAD-7 (d=−0.14). No significant differences were evident in the proportion of participants in each condition reporting elevated levels of generalised anxiety. A significant condition by time interaction was found for mental wellbeing; however, this result was in favour of the wait-list control condition. Significant differences were observed between the wait-list and e-GAD school method conditions at post-intervention (d=−0.08) and 6-month follow-up (d=−0.30) and between the wait-list and e-GAD health service method conditions at 6-month follow-up (d=−0.24). Taken together, the findings of the current study fail to support the primary hypothesis that the program would be an effective preventive intervention.
The positive effect observed in the e-GAD health service method condition for social anxiety at 6-month follow-up is comparable to the effects obtained in other online interventions for anxiety in schools (Calear et al., 2009, Wong et al., 2014). However, the positive effects for anxiety sensitivity and mental wellbeing obtained in the pilot trial of the e-couch Anxiety and Worry program were not replicated in the current study. Rather, a significant negative effect was observed for mental wellbeing in the current trial, and no intervention effect was observed for anxiety sensitivity. The reasons for these contradictory findings were not clear, although possible explanations may include differential program engagement, potential anxiogenic effects of the intervention, or external events (e.g., exams) occurring at particular schools prior to questionnaire completion that may have skewed the findings.
The results of the current study raise the possibility that it may be difficult to reduce anxiety using a targeted generalised anxiety disorder intervention. A number of the effective anxiety prevention programs in schools have targeted non-specific anxiety (Neil and Christensen, 2009), which may have increased their reach and appeal. Focusing specifically on one type of anxiety may be too limiting in a universal context in which many types of anxiety may be present. The present intervention therefore may be more suited to targeting young people at risk of developing generalised anxiety.
It is also possible that anxiety interventions may be anxiogenic for a proportion of participants, priming them to feel more anxious. Interestingly, in a school-based evaluation of two online interventions, the This Way Up depression program had a stronger effect (d=0.29 vs. 0.18) on anxiety symptoms than the This Way Up anxiety program (Wong et al., 2014). This suggests that not focusing on anxiety but targeting a different and often related mental health condition may be more effective. Further research exploring the potential anxiogenic effects of anxiety prevention programs is needed.
Participant attrition due to assessment absenteeism was a problem in the current trial, which might also offer an explanation for the effect. For instance, a number of schools had difficulties scheduling questionnaires and completing the intervention, and often did not have the time or resources to follow up participants who missed classes. Attrition in the current study was generally associated with poorer status on outcome measures pre-intervention and with completion of fewer modules. Therefore, the potential benefits associated with the intervention may not have been assessed among those who had the highest levels of symptoms at pre-intervention or among those who did not engage fully with the intervention. In future research, it is important to ensure that schools have the resources and time to participate in evaluation trials, as high attrition can affect trial outcomes.
Participants in the e-GAD health service method condition generally completed more of the e-couch Anxiety and Worry program than participants in the e-GAD school method condition, supporting the second hypothesis. However, the e-GAD health service method condition did not appear to increase intervention effects, thus failing to support the third hypothesis that enhanced delivery would improve outcomes. The current study did not explicitly test student learning from each module. Therefore it is possible that students in the e-GAD health service condition logged onto the program more frequently, due to the presence of the headspace education officer, but did not engage with the material once logged on and hence failed to respond to the intervention. In future research it would be of interest to assess student learning at the completion of each program module, through non-assessable quizzes or classroom exercises, to ascertain the level of program engagement and whether the skills and strategies taught in the program are retained.
The strengths of the current study include the broad population of students recruited to the trial, the random allocation of schools to the intervention and wait-list control conditions, the use of reliable and valid measures of anxiety, depression and mental wellbeing, and the novel application of headspace education officers in the classroom. The current study is also one of the first large-scale evaluations of an online anxiety program in schools.
The limitations of the current study also need to be considered. These include the use of self-report measures that may have been influenced by situational factors or biases and the inability to collect complete data from all participants due to absence or school relocation. Defensible missing data techniques were employed in the current study, but these are never a perfect substitute for complete observations. The e-couch Anxiety and Worry program has been shown to be effective as a treatment program for adults (Christensen et al., 2014). This suggests that the program may be better suited to a higher literacy population who are motivated to engage with the program due to their high level of symptoms.
Overall, the results of the current study did not find evidence that the e-couch Anxiety and Worry program prevented anxiety among high school students. Given the appeal and potential effectiveness of online interventions among young people, it is important to develop short, interactive programs that suit their needs. Such interventions may capture the interest of young people, who prefer small pieces of information presented in novel ways, and may also be more suitable for implementation in the limited time made available to schools to educate and promote youth mental health.
