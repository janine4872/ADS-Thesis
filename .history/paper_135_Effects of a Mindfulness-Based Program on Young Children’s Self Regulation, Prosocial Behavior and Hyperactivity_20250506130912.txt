Abstract
Classroom environments need to provide young children with opportunities to practice self-regulation in order to develop social and emotional competence. The effects of a mindfulness-based program on self-regulation, prosocial behavior and hyperactivity were examined in a study of 127 children (ages 4–6) in 8 kindergarten classrooms that were randomly assigned to either a Mindfulness Group (n = 72) or to a Control Group (n = 55). The program consisted of 20-minute lessons, delivered 3 times a week, for 6 weeks. The Head-Toes-Knees-Shoulders (HTKS) was used as a direct performance-based measure of self-regulation. The teacher version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used to assess prosocial behavior and hyperactivity. Data were collected before (Time 1) and after (Time 2) the 6-week period of the study intervention. Results indicated that children in the Mindfulness Group showed greater improvement in self-regulation, F (1, 124) = 10.70, p = .001 (=.079), were more prosocial (z = −4.152, p < .001) and less hyperactive (z = −3.377, p = .001) compared to children in the Control Group at Time 2. This was especially true for children who had lower scores at Time 1 (HTKS; rho = −.551, p < .001; Prosocial Behavior scale; rho = −.69, p < .001 and the Hyperactivity scale; rho = −.39, p < .001). Results highlight the benefits of mindfulness-based programs in kindergarten classrooms and indicate that they are particularly effective for children with difficulties in these areas.

Introduction
Self-regulation and social and emotional competence are significant predictors of school success (e.g., McClelland and Cameron 2012; O’Brien et al. 2003). Researchers examining self-regulation in educational settings define the behavioral aspects of self-regulation as “deliberately applying attentional flexibility, working memory, and inhibitory control to overt actions” (McClelland and Cameron 2011, p. 32). Moreover, self-regulation plays a key role in children’s adaptive behaviors related to social and emotional competence (such as prosocial behavior) (Liew 2012; Riggs et al. 2006). Conversely, children with maladaptive behaviors (such as hyperactivity) are characterized by difficulties in key areas of self-regulation such as attention and inhibitory control. As such, children with deficits in self-regulation also show problems with social and emotional competence (Diamond 2005; Semrud-Clikeman and Schafer 2000). Young children’s first experiences in educational settings coincides with a period when their self-regulation abilities are developing rapidly (e.g., Bodrova and Leong 2008; Garon et al. 2008). Indeed, these abilities are taxed as young children are required to meet the demands of the classroom (e.g., Willis and Dinehart 2014; Zelazo and Lyons 2011).

The healthy development of children’s self-regulation in kindergarten classrooms is supported through the interaction of all the elements in their environment. Indeed, “[t]hrough this reciprocal pathway, classrooms that set the stage for students to practice self-regulation skills could thus have lasting positive impacts on children’s school competence and achievement” (Ursache et al. 2012, p.126). Kindergarten classrooms that are developmentally appropriate offer children a learning environment that is planned based on knowledge of child development (Charlesworth 1998). A developmentally appropriate classroom is designed to support self-regulation with the understanding that “social, emotional and cognitive learning are interconnected to a greater extent in younger children” (Nissen and Hawkins 2010, p. 256). Therefore programs introduced in kindergarten classrooms designed to practice self-regulation skills might contribute to children’s overall school success.

Mindfulness is commonly defined as “paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally” (Kabat-Zinn 1994, p. 4) and a number of studies have shown evidence of the positive impact of practicing mindfulness on areas of self-regulation (e.g., Black and Fernando 2014; Flook et al. 2015). Given the importance of self-regulation for school success, over the last few years, various mindfulness-based programs have been specifically designed to cater to students in classroom settings (see Meiklejohn et al. 2012 for a review). The host of outcomes associated with implementing mindfulness-based programs in school-age and high school classrooms includes better executive functions, self-control and attention (e.g., Black and Fernando 2014; Flook et al. 2010), improved social skills and caring for others (e.g., Schonert-Reichl et al. 2015) as well as increased emotional regulation and overall wellbeing (e.g., Broderick and Metz 2009). In light of these reported benefits for children and adolescents in school-age and high school classrooms, researchers are beginning to explore the effects of mindfulness-based programs on young children in early childhood classrooms.

With this in mind, given the links between practicing mindfulness and self-regulation discussed earlier, the implementation of a mindfulness-based program in developmentally appropriate kindergarten classrooms would complement children’s experiences and enhance their development of self-regulation. In fact, a recent study has shown that implementing a 12-week mindfulness-based program in preschool classrooms showed gains in areas related to self-regulation and social and emotional competence (Flook et al. 2015).

The current study used a randomized control trial methodology to examine changes in children’s self-regulation and prosocial and maladaptive behaviors following the implementation of a mindfulness-based program adapted for kindergarten classrooms. Specifically, this study had the following objectives: (1) to test whether, as hypothesized, change in self-regulation would be greater for children in the Mindfulness Group compared to children in the Control Group; (2) to test whether, as hypothesized, teachers would report greater improvements in children’s prosocial behavior for children in the Mindfulness Group compared to the children in the Control Group. We also hypothesized that certain maladaptive behaviors (such as those related to hyperactivity) that are associated with lower levels of self-regulation would improve more than others. Finally, (3) we hypothesized that children who were less self-regulated, less prosocial and more hyperactive prior to the intervention would benefit more in terms of improvements in self-regulation, prosocial behavior and hyperactivity, than children who were average or higher functioning in those areas to begin with.

Method
Participants
The sample consisted of children attending kindergarten at three public schools in the ethnically diverse city of Toronto, Ontario in Canada. In Ontario, kindergarten classrooms are made up of children between the ages 3 years, 9 months (called Junior Kindergarten, JK) and 6 years, 5 months (called Senior Kindergarten, SK). All participating classrooms in this study were JK/SK “splits” which means they had children in Junior and Senior Kindergarten. The total number of students housed in School 1 and School 2 from K to Grade 6 was 219 students and 288 students respectively. School 3 housed students from K to Grade 8, with 423 students in total. In School 1 the percentage of students whose primary language was other than English was 82%. In School 2 it was 43% and in School 3, 49%. All 474 schools in the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) are ranked using the Learning Opportunities Index (LOI). The LOI is based on measures of external challenges (e.g., parents’ education and income, poverty and proportion of lone-parent families) that are known to impact student achievement. That is, the school that ranks first (1 on the LOI) experiences the highest levels of external challenges whereas the school that ranks last (474 on the LOI) experiences the lowest levels of external challenges. At the time of the study (2012), the rankings for the schools in this study were 183, 180 and 115 for Schools 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Therefore, all three schools in this study experienced somewhat higher levels of external challenges affecting student success than the general population of schools in the TDSB.

Schools 1 and 3 had three participating classrooms and School 2 had four. All classrooms that agreed to participate in each of our three schools were randomly assigned to either the Mindfulness or the Control Group. The one exception to this is that in order to have an equal number of classrooms participating in the study from each school, for both schools with an odd number of classrooms, we randomly assigned one classroom to the Mindfulness Group and one classroom to a Control Group. The third classrooms in both of these schools did not participate in the study. However, at the request of teachers, the mindfulness-based program was delivered in those two classrooms following the intervention period. For School 2 (which had four participating classrooms) we randomly assigned two classrooms to the Mindfulness Group and the other two classrooms to the Control Group. As all teachers had initially expressed interest in having the program delivered in their classroom, we implemented the mindfulness-based program to the four classrooms in the Control Group after the study was completed.

Participant recruitment was initiated in mid-March and information about the study was sent to parents of all children in the eight classrooms from the three participating schools. Although all students from the classrooms that were assigned to the Mindfulness Group participated in the mindfulness-based program, data were only collected from students whose parents consented to participate in the study. Data from 127 children (58% boys, 42% girls) were included in the present study. Seventy-two children were in the Mindfulness Group (57% boys, 43% girls) and 55 children were in the Control Group (60% boys, 40% girls). Consistent with the relative size of the schools, 29 children were from School 1 (19 in the Mindfulness Group and 10 in the Control Group); 28 children were from School 2 (15 in the Mindfulness Group and 13 in the Control Group) and 70 children were from School 3 (38 in the Mindfulness Group and 32 in the Control Group). See Fig. 1 for a CONSORT diagram depicting participant flow including consent rates. At Time 1, participants in both the Mindfulness Group and the Control Group were between the ages of 4 years, 3 months and 6 years, 3 months (Mean age in months = 62.32, SD = 7.5 months for the Mindfulness Group and 61.36, SD = 7.1 months for the Control Group).

Procedure
At both Time 1 and Time 2, trained research assistants administered the HTKS individually to each child participating in the study. The research assistants involved in data collection at Time 2 were unaware of the group status of the participants. At both Time 1 and Time 2, teachers were asked to fill out the SDQ for each child participating in the study. Between Time 1 and Time 2, the mindfulness-based program was implemented in the four classrooms that had been randomly assigned to the Mindfulness Group. We selected the Mindful Schools program as it is research based and the organization is a pioneer in integrating mindfulness into education. The primary researcher was trained and certified to implement the program and received permission from the developers to use it for this study. She delivered the mindfulness program in all classrooms involved in this study.

The program consisted of 18 twenty-minute lessons, delivered three times a week for a total of six weeks. To maintain consistency in implementation, the mindfulness teacher followed each lesson as outlined in the Mindful Schools’ teacher manual to each of the four classrooms.

The lessons in the program provided a good balance between various “external” (see Supplementary Materials “Class One” for a sample lesson on “Mindful Listening”) and “internal” experiential mindful awareness practices (see Supplementary Materials “Class Two” for a sample lesson on “Mindfulness of Breathing”). For example, children practiced focusing their attention on breathing (internal) as well as walking, eating and seeing (external). Another valuable component of this program is the inclusion of lessons on “Heartfulness”. These lessons explored themes such as kindness and caring through various experiential mindful awareness practices, for example by having children practice developing kind and caring thoughts toward themselves and others (see Supplementary Materials “Class Three” for a sample “Heartfulness” lesson). Following each lesson, children were asked to write or draw in their “Mindfulness Journals” relating to the new mindful awareness practice they learned that day. Children were also encouraged to practice what they learned and to teach their family members at home. Children were asked to share about these experiences at the beginning of each session.

Measures
Self-regulation in children
The Head-Toes-Knees-Shoulders (HTKS) was developed by Cameron Ponitz et al. (2008) to measure behavioral aspects of self-regulation including controlling and directing actions, inhibitory control, paying attention, and remembering instructions for children ages 3½ to 6½ years. The HTKS is introduced as a game and has 3 parts with the same instructions and scoring. The first part begins with two paired rules: “touch your head” and “touch your toes”. The child is instructed to switch the rules by responding the opposite way. Two points are scored for following the instructions correctly (i.e., child touches their toes when told to touch their head), 1 point is scored for “self-correcting” (i.e., child makes any motion toward the incorrect response but then makes the correct response instead) and 0 points are scored if the child touches the incorrect body part (i.e., either the child does not touch the correct body part at all or he/she touches the named part rather than the opposite one). The child needs to score at least 4 points to move on to the next part. The second part has the same instructions but with different paired rules; “touch your knees” and “touch your shoulders”. Once again, the child needs to score at least 4 points to move onto the third and final part, which includes all four paired rules with the same instructions. Each of the 3 parts has 10 commands (with a range of 0–20 points per part) therefore the HTKS scores range from 0 to 60.

The HTKS was chosen for this study as previous research indicates that the HTKS is a valid measure demonstrating variability in children’s scores, high inter-rater reliability (ϰ > . 90) and internal consistency estimates above .80 (e.g., McClelland and Cameron 2012; Lonigan et al. 2017; Montroy et al. 2014; Schmitt et al. 2014). Moreover, scores on the HTKS have been shown to correlate with other direct measures of self-regulation in studies with children in a similar age group as the children in this study (e.g., Allan et al. 2011). Thus, the HTKS has been frequently used to measure self-regulation in children in classroom settings (e.g., Hur et al. 2015). In addition, the HTKS typically requires no more than 10 min to administer.

Prosocial and maladaptive behaviors in children
The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire is a brief behavioral screening questionnaire developed by Goodman (1997) used to measure prosocial and maladaptive behaviors in children. The measure consists of 25 items that are divided equally between 5 scales: Prosocial Behavior, Hyperactivity, Conduct Problems, Emotional Symptoms and Peer Problems (Goodman 1997). Informants (i.e., teachers, parents) rate how closely the target child fits with each attribute on a 3-point scale as “Not true”, “Somewhat true” or “Certainly true”. Scores range from 0–2 for each item and scores can be averaged out to generate a score for each scale with a total of 10 points. A Total Difficulties score can be generated by adding up scores for all 4 scales related to the maladaptive behaviors (0–40).

The five SDQ subscales have sufficient internal consistency (average Cronbach’s α = .73) (Goodman 2001) despite being based on only 5 items each. The instrument also shows good test-retest reliability (Goodman 2001) which indicates stability of the scores and suggests that the instrument can be used in longitudinal studies measuring change over time. Based on these properties, SDQ was chosen for this study. Moreover, to ensure that these properties held true with the sample used in this study, Cronbach’s alpha was computed for each SDQ subscale in the sample to investigate the internal consistency of the subscale scores. The Cronbach’s alpha values for the five SDQ subscales based on the sample used in this study ranged between 0.72 and 0.91, indicating a high internal consistency with the sample in this study. In addition, the SDQ was selected as it is a brief measure, requiring approximately 5 min to complete (Goodman and Scott 1999).

Data Analyses
Given the nested structure of the data (students within classrooms) before conducting statistical analyses addressing the questions in this study, we explored for the presence of the nesting effect by conducting variance components analyses using a multi-level modeling technique. The proportion of variance at the classroom level for different outcome variables ranged between 3% and 16% and was non-significant for all of them. Based on these results, the analyses for this study were conducted at the student-level.

The dependent variables in this study were the HTKS scores and the scores on the SDQ scales. The HTKS scores ranged from 0–60 and were normally distributed. Although each individual SDQ score ranged from 0–2 points, each scale consisted of 5 items and therefore, a potential range of scores has 10 points. A variable with such a range would typically be considered continuous in statistical analyses. However, as the scale for prosocial behaviors (Prosocial Behavior scale) was negatively skewed (i.e., indicating that most children exhibit a higher level of prosocial behaviors), whereas the other four scales measuring maladaptive behaviors (Hyperactivity, Conduct Problems, Emotional Symptoms and Peer Problems), were positively skewed (i.e., indicating that fewer children exhibit a high level of maladaptive behaviors), these variables could not be assumed to be normally distributed for statistical analyses. The nature and distributional properties of these variables dictated the choice of statistical tools for the analyses in this study. As such, parametric statistical tests were selected for addressing the questions related to HTKS scores and nonparametric statistical tests were selected for investigating the questions related to the scores from the SDQ scales. Transformations of the skewed SDQ scales was deemed inappropriate due to different direction of the skewedness of the subscales, which would require different types of transformations, and, therefore, complicate the interpretations of the results.

Before running statistical analyses addressing the research questions in this study, the equivalence of the baseline scores and child characteristics across the two conditions was examined. This was an important step considering that the sampling for this study was performed on the classroom level, which could result in non-equivalence of the samples between the two conditions. The average HTKS scores were similar between the two conditions and among the classrooms in each condition, indicating that the average level of self-regulation was similar in the two groups at Time 1 and that there was no classroom effect to control for. However, differences in SDQ scores were found between the two conditions at Time 1 for one of the five SDQ scales. This is discussed in the results section below.

An ANCOVA was performed to investigate whether change in HTKS scores between Time 1 and Time 2 was different in the Mindfulness Group and the Control Group. Because the SDQ scores had skewed distributions, nonparametric tests were adopted to address this question for each of the scales of this questionnaire. There is no nonparametric method similar to ANCOVA; therefore, these analyses had to be conducted in two steps: 1) comparing the distributions of the SDQ scores between the Mindfulness Group and the Control Group at Time 1 to establish the group equivalence; and 2) comparing the distributions of the SDQ scores at Time 2 to evaluate the difference in change of the SDQ scores between the two groups. Both steps were performed using Mann-Whitney U tests.

To explore whether the HTKS and the SDQ scores at Time 1 were related to the amount of change the children in the Mindfulness Group experienced between Time 1 and Time 2, correlation analyses between Time 1 scores and change scores between Time 1 and Time 2 were computed.

Results
To investigate whether the post-intervention scores on the self-regulation measures were different in the Mindfulness Group and the Control Group, an ANCOVA was conducted. HTKS scores at Time 2 served as a dependent variable in this analysis, HTKS scores at Time 1 were included as a covariate and the grouping variable (Mindfulness vs. Control) was used as a between subjects factor. Change in HTKS scores for each group over time is depicted in Fig. 2a. The results of the ANCOVA indicated a significant difference in the adjusted means of the Mindfulness Group and the Control Group at Time 2, F (1, 124) = 10.70, p = .001. The magnitude of the effect size is 
 = .079 which is interpreted as a medium effect. That is, approximately 8% of the variance in HTKS scores at Time 2 is attributable to the intervention when controlling for HTKS scores for both groups at Time 1. The Mindfulness Group had a higher adjusted mean at post-test (M = 35.83, SE = 1.37) than the Control Group (M = 29.00, SE = 1.57) indicating that controlling for Time 1 performance, the Mindfulness Group exhibited better self-regulatory abilities at Time 2 than the Control Group.

Pearson correlations between children’s HTKS scores at Time 1 and Time 2 were computed within the Mindfulness Group and the Control Group to test whether the change in means observed in each group reflect a pattern that is consistent for all children. The relationship between HTKS scores at Time 1 and Time 2 was strong for the Mindfulness Group (r = . 73, p < .001) and moderate for the Control Group (r = .68, p < .001). The results indicate that individual children in each group experienced a similar amount of change in their self-regulation scores across the two time points (although the average increase was higher in the Mindfulness Group).

A Mann-Whitney U test for each of the five scales of the SDQ was conducted to determine whether there were any differences in prosocial and maladaptive behaviors between the Mindfulness Group and the Control Group at Time 1. Because the analyses of SDQ scores relied on nonparametric statistical methods, mean ranks were used for computations. However, because the mean ranks are not intuitive to understand, the mean scores for the SDQ scales are reported as well (see Table 1 for the descriptive statistics for SDQ scores for both groups at Time 1 and Time 2). The results of the Mann-Whitney U were significant only for the Prosocial Behavior scale, z = −2.606, p = .009. Specifically, the Mindfulness Group had a mean rank of 56.25, whereas the Control Group had a mean rank of 73.17 at Time 1. Thus, at the beginning of the study, children in the Control Group exhibited significantly higher levels of prosocial behavior compared to children in the Mindfulness Group.

Mann-Whitney U tests were conducted to evaluate whether the total change scores for each of the 5 scales of the SDQ were different in the Mindfulness Group compared to the Control Group at Time 2. The results of the test were significant for the Prosocial Behavior scale (z = −4.152, p < .001); the Mindfulness Group had a mean rank of 74.81, whereas the Control Group had a mean rank of 48.42 and for the Hyperactivity scale (z = −3.377, p = .001); the Mindfulness Group had a mean rank of 54.26, whereas the Control Group had a mean rank of 75.82. Note that as multiple comparisons were made (one for each of the five scales of the SDQ), to reduce the likelihood that findings were significant only by chance, an adjusted alpha of .01 (Bonferroni correction was used by dividing the familywise alpha of 0.05 by the number of analyses) was considered as significant. Change in SDQ Prosocial Behavior scores for both groups over time is depicted in Fig. 2b and change in SDQ Hyperactivity scores for both groups over time is depicted in Fig. 2c. The difference between the two groups was not significant for the other three scales.

To investigate whether HTKS scores at Time 1 were associated with gains at Time 2 in the Mindfulness Group, a Spearman correlation was computed with Time 1 scores and change scores. The results showed significant and moderately strong results, rho = −.551, p < .001. These results suggest that children who started off with lower self-regulation scores on the HTKS benefited more from the mindfulness-based program than children who were average or higher functioning prior to participating in the program (see Fig. 3a for a scatterplot depiction of these results).

A Spearman correlation was also computed to investigate whether teachers’ perceptions of Prosocial Behavior and Hyperactivity SDQ scores at Time 1 were associated with gains at Time 2. The results showed moderate to strong significant negative relationship for both scales of the SDQ (rho = −.69, p < .001 and rho = −.39, p < .001 correspondingly). This suggests that children with lower scores on the Prosocial Behavior scale (compared to ones with higher scores) and children with higher scores on the Hyperactivity scale (compared to ones with lower scores) benefited more from the mindfulness-based program (see Fig. 3b and c for a scatterplot depictions of these results).

Discussion
The present study was designed to examine the effects of a mindfulness-based program for children in kindergarten classrooms. Mindfulness-based programs offer a variety of benefits for the healthy development of skills related to success in the classroom. In this study, we measured changes in children’s self-regulation, prosocial behavior and hyperactivity after implementing the Mindful Schools program adapted for kindergarten classrooms. Overall, we found that the brief Mindful Schools intervention was effective with 3–6 year old children. These findings are consistent with contributions made from other studies that used smaller samples (i.e., Flook et al.’s (2015) preschool sample of 68 vs. our sample of 127) and longer intervention periods (i.e., Flook et al.’s (2015) study was 12 weeks compared to our six week intervention) exploring similar outcomes. In addition to the similar outcomes reported by Flook et al. (2015) (i.e., self-regulation and prosocial behavior), we used a measure of behavioral self-regulation that also included a component of working memory and included a measure of hyperactivity to the child outcomes. Furthermore, our study expands the research to a sample of highly linguistically and culturally diverse classrooms in Toronto, Canada. In the section that follows, we review the findings for each of the three objectives of this study.

The first objective was to determine if the 6-week mindfulness-based program would improve children’s self-regulation. Despite showing similar levels of self-regulation prior to the intervention, the children in classrooms that received the mindfulness-based program demonstrated significantly stronger self-regulation skills than the Control Group at post-test. These findings also suggest that the implementation of a mindfulness-based program over a relatively short period of time has the potential to improve the development of self-regulation in young children.

As mentioned, our findings are similar to those reported by Flook et al. (2010) whose sample was comprised of an older group of children (ages 7–9 years) as well as Flook et al. (2015) recent study with preschool children. Results from both studies showed that changes in aspects of self-regulation for children in classrooms receiving a mindfulness-based program were greater than for children in a control group. This evidence also confirms that participating in programs that explicitly engage children in tasks that foster self-regulation improves this skill over time and is consistent with evidence from studies looking at the success of programs aimed to improve self-regulation (e.g., Diamond and Lee 2011).

The second objective was to determine if the 6-week mindfulness-based program would improve children’s prosocial behavior and hyperactivity. The teacher version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was used to capture teachers’ perceptions of these behaviors as listed as items on the Prosocial Behavior and Hyperactivity scales. To determine if improvements in each area were greater for children who received the mindfulness-based program, we compared the overall change from Time 1 to Time 2 in these scales for children in the Mindfulness Group to children in the Control Group.

Consistent with our hypothesis, children in classrooms that received the mindfulness-based program improved more in teacher ratings of their prosocial behavior when compared to children in classrooms that did not receive the program. The scores of children in the Mindfulness Group increased on all five items that make up the Prosocial Behavior scale suggesting that the mindfulness-based program made children more (1) considerate, (2) helpful and (3) caring as well as more likely (4) to share and (5) to be kind to younger children. This finding supports research showing that mindful awareness practices such as those included in the mindfulness-based program promote prosocial behavior (i.e., Kemeny et al. 2012).

Also consistent with our hypothesis, scores of children in the Mindfulness Group increased more on all five items that make up the Hyperactivity scale compared to children in the Control Group. The 5 items of the Hyperactivity scale are meant to tap behaviors related to impulsiveness (1 item), inattention (2 items) and hyperactivity (2 items) (Goodman 2001). Reid et al. (2005) found that children who exhibit symptoms related to hyperactivity benefit from self-regulation interventions. The strengthening of these skills may be responsible for children’s reduction of maladaptive behaviors related to the Hyperactivity scale. It is believed that teaching children mindfulness can improve impulse-control and decrease emotional reactivity (Thompson and Gauntlett-Gilbert 2008). Children who are characterized as being impulsive appear to lack inhibitory control (Schachar and Tannock 1993). Therefore, our findings are consistent with research showing the association between mindfulness and inhibitory control in children (Oberle et al. 2012) and extends preliminary research showing that mindfulness reduces impulsivity in youth (Rynczak 2012). Also, our findings are consistent with research showing that children practicing mindfulness show a reduction in attention problems (Semple et al. 2010) and that engaging in exercises that involve internal attention such as meditation increases children’s capacity to regulate attention (Rani and Rao 1996). In fact, Napoli et al. (2005) found that elementary school children participating in a mindfulness-based program performed better on a computer task designed to measure selective attention than children in a control group.

The third objective was to determine if children with difficulties in self-regulation and maladaptive behaviors would benefit more from the 6-week mindfulness-based program than children without difficulties. The findings are consistent with our hypothesis; children in the Mindfulness Group with lower self-regulation and with more difficulties in prosocial behaviors and hyperactivity at Time 1 showed greater improvements in these areas after the mindfulness-based program (Time 2) than children who were average or higher functioning in those areas. The findings with respect to self-regulation are consistent with Flook et al. (2010) who also found that a mindfulness-based program proved to be most beneficial for somewhat older children with low baselines of self-regulation. In addition, Flook et al. (2015) also found that preschool aged children who were initially lower in executive functioning and social competence, showed larger gains than children in a control group. These findings further support the idea that children with difficulties in certain key developmental skills benefit most from interventions that include activities, exercises and/or games designed to improve self-regulation (Diamond 2012; Tominey and McClelland 2011).

The evidence from this study adds to the growing body of research investigating the relationship between mindfulness-based programs, self-regulation and prosocial behavior and hyperactivity in young children. Riggs et al.’s (2006) reviewed interventions aimed to promote children’s prosocial behavior and stressed the importance of addressing self-regulation skills in such programs. The mindfulness-based program used in this study incorporated several age-appropriate practices designed to foster young children’s developing self-regulation and prosocial behavior. In turn, gains in self-regulation helped decrease children’s maladaptive behaviors related to hyperactivity. In addition, results from this study also demonstrate the efficacy and feasibility of implementing a relatively brief, age-appropriate mindfulness-based program in early childhood classrooms (e.g., Burke 2010; Greenberg and Harris 2012).

Limitations
Children in the Mindfulness Group in this study improved on the Prosocial Behavior scale and the Hyperactivity scale on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire for teachers. Teachers are an important source of knowledge about the children in their classrooms as they can report on stable behavioral tendencies such as those captured by the SDQ. For logistical reasons, it was not possible for teachers to be blind to whether their classroom had been assigned to the intervention or control group. This knowledge may have influenced their reports on students’ prosocial and hyperactivity at Time 2. However, as mentioned earlier, as a way to reduce potential bias, the HTKS was administered by trained research assistants who were blind to the condition at Time 2. Moreover, the results across the HTKS and the SDQ are consistent with the study’s hypotheses and highly consistent with one another. Thus, while reporter bias is always a concern, and especially so in the case of teachers in our study who could not be blind to the study condition, together results based on the SDQ and the HTKS suggests that the intervention had an impact. To minimize the issue of reporter bias, researchers should use the approach we adopted in this study using the HTKS with a broader range of outcomes. Specifically, direct performance-based tasks administered by researchers who are blind to the conditions of the classrooms, are the best option for determining the impact of mindfulness-based programs on children’s prosocial behavior and hyperactivity.

Another limitation to this study relates to the possibility that there was variability in how the intervention was implemented across each classroom. As mentioned, the Mindful Schools program provides structured content for each session and was administered by the primary researcher in all classrooms in this study. This built in some consistency in the implementation of the program however, fidelity of the intervention was not tested directly and future studies should do so.

Contamination is always a possibility in a design like the one used in this study. One way to minimize contamination is to have a trained instructor, rather than the teacher, administer the program. Teachers in the intervention classrooms were asked to participate in the exercises with their students in order for them to learn about the program and the concepts as a whole. The fact that they were not trained to deliver the intervention may reduce the likelihood that they would feel “ready” to share what they were learning with other teachers during the period of time that the program was being implemented. Another way to discourage contamination is to provide the control classrooms with the intervention at a later date to reduce the likelihood that teachers in those classrooms would feel the need to attempt to provide it. These practices were implemented in the current study in an effort to reduce contamination but they do not eliminate its possibility. It is important to note that if contamination did occur it would have reduced differences between the classrooms in the two conditions. Thus, the issue of contamination does not call into question whether the intervention was effective, but instead raises the possibility that it might be more effective than we were able to show.

Finally, it is likely that there was variability in the number of lessons children experienced due to absenteeism. As absenteeism information was not collected in the current study we can only speak to the impact of the intervention on average assuming similar participation from all children. Future research should collect this information to explore the impact of dosage in a more fine-grained way.

Despite these limitations, the current study bodes well for the potential efficacy of implementing mindfulness-based programs in early childhood classrooms. The findings of this study support the proposition made by Masicampo and Baumeister (2007) that general increases in self-regulation “may be the causal link between mindfulness interventions and the benefits that have been associated with them” (p. 255). Moreover, the findings of this study demonstrate the benefits of introducing mindfulness to children in early childhood. This highlights the need for future research on the factors involved in implementing programs aimed to improve children’s self-regulation and behavior in early childhood classrooms. Examination of the various aspects involved in mindfulness-based programs would greatly assist the development of and refinements to the design of such programs. Moreover, further exploration of these aspects would also provide invaluable information about how mindfulness-based programs benefit young children in early childhood classrooms. Lastly, if teachers learn to embrace the ideas and practices in mindfulness-based programs they could continue to infuse mindfulness into their existing program. In turn, not only would their students benefit from the effects reported in this study, but their ongoing supported practice beyond the 20-minute lessons and the 6-week period, could potentially reap those benefits in a lasting and sustainable way.
