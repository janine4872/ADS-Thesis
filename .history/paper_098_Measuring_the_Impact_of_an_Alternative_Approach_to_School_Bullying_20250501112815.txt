National estimates of middle school bullying approximate 40%, making it the leading form of school violence. Meta-analysis of conventional anti-bullying efforts have shown mixed results, averaging small reductions in bullying behavior. Social-Emotional Learning and Positive Youth Development provide a theory-driven alternative for approaching bullying and victimization by strengthening social competencies that reduce related youth risk behaviors.

A sample of 7th grade students (N = 323) participated in Take the Lead (TTL); a 16-session curriculum designed to build social competencies of all participants. Data were coded and collected using a pretest/posttest time-lag control group cohort study design. Participants self-reported bully and victim behaviors using the Peer Relations Questionnaire. Extracted data were assessed for changes in bullying and victim behaviors, from pretest to posttest, between groups and sexes.

Participants in TTL reported significant reductions in bullying (p < .001), and victimization (p < .001), from pretest to posttest, and compared to controls (p < .001). Findings remained consistent between sexes (p < .001). Control groups experienced increases in bully and victim behaviors during the same time period, which were significantly reduced following participation in TTL (p < .001).

Identifying intervention alternatives to address bullying behaviors must remain a research priority. This study supports the application of theory-driven SEL and PYD constructs within a curriculum designed to improve social competencies of all students.

Once considered an annoying rite of passage into adolescence, bullying is currently the leading form of school violence,1 with pervasive and destructive effects that persist into adulthood.2 The National Center for Education Statistics reports that approximately 40% of middle school students are involved in bullying, as victim, bully, or bully/victim, at least once per week, with peak bullying rates occurring at 6th through 8th grades, then steadily decreasing to 20% by 12th grade.1 Students between the ages of 8 and 15 rank bullying as one of the most severe and pressing problems they face, more problematic than AIDS, racism, alcohol/drugs, and pressure to engage in sexual activity.3 As national statistics suggest, middle school bullying requires immediate attention and amelioration, as it represents the highest rates of physical bullying among boys,4 peak rates of relational bullying among girls,5 and onset of cyberbullying across sexes.6

Three decades of bullying research has provided important descriptive data delineating the size and scope of the problem, precursors of bully and victim behavior, and a wide range of associated physical, emotional, and psychological sequelae.7, 8 Research has expanded the definition of bullying to encompass a distinct set of elements including, intentional, repeated acts of cruelty (physical, social, and/or psychological), characterized by power imbalance between perpetrator and target.9 Early intervention models, informed by descriptive data, focused on modification of bully and victim behavior.10 Meta-analysis of the effectiveness of conventional anti-bullying interventions has been mixed, averaging small reductions, if any change, in overall bullying behavior.10-12 More recently, intervention research has examined the impact of theory-driven models that address the social supports that influence youth behaviors and school climate.13 These multi-tier socioecologic models aimed at improving school climate have shown promise, with corresponding reductions in bullying exceeding 50%.14 Notably, Dan Olweus, Norwegian bullying prevention pioneer, provided a model for reducing bullying utilizing a “whole-school climate” approach whereby family, school, and community act as reciprocal partners in the reduction of bullying.14 Olweus's Bullying Prevention Program, which incorporates a curriculum, school policy, and youth and adult training, demonstrated nationwide reductions in school bullying in Norway that had not been achieved with conventional anti-bullying models.12 Social-ecologic programs have moved prevention and intervention research forward by identifying theory-driven constructs that reduce bullying behaviors;14 however, replication of results to multiple populations, including in the United States, has been limited,15, 16 prompting the current evaluation of a different theoretical approach.

Best practice asserts that anti-bullying programs utilize a combination of theory-driven approaches with multiple touch points and employ varying modalities to reduce negative outcomes.13 Currently there is a paucity of intervention research employing different modalities and theoretical underpinnings to reduce bullying among middle school students. This paper extends the body of literature, examining the impact of a theory-driven Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) and Positive Youth Development (PYD) program on bullying behaviors among a sample of suburban 7th grade students. Take the Lead (TTL) is a middle school curriculum designed to increase the social competencies of participants.17 Lack of social competence has been associated with bullying behaviors consistently across continents, sexes, and age groups.18 Bystander's lack of social competence responding to bullying situations has been identified as a catalyst, escalating negative outcomes.19, 20 An important component of the evaluation of TTL was the assessment of the application of social competencies to youth risk behaviors, such as bullying. This article provides a brief theoretical framework and resultant findings of a pretest-posttest control group cohort study of TTL on student bullying behaviors.

Grounded in Mayer and Salavoy's work on emotional intelligence,21 and Daniel Goleman's theories of emotional and social intelligence,22 SEL reflects a theoretical shift in emphasis from deficit-base (stopping negative behaviors) to strength-base (building social competencies) behavior change.23 The social competencies specified within the SEL framework are self-awareness, social-awareness, self-management, relationship skills, and decision making.24 Meta-analysis of 213 SEL studies involving 270,034 K-12 students revealed that the acquisition of these social and emotional competencies is linked to significant improvements in interpersonal relationships, conduct problems, social skills, emotional distress, substance abuse, and aggression.25 Mechanisms identified as contributing to successful program impact were the development and application of social skills, strong social supports (eg, family, school), and reinforcement of positive behaviors.26

Positive Youth Development (PYD) is an example of SEL designed to promote healthy outcomes by strengthening social and emotional competencies. This is achieved by developing, then applying individual and group skills, such as communication, team-building, problem solving, and leadership, while supporting the environmental constructs that shape and support the child.26 Meta-analysis of 25 PYD curricular programs showed significant positive changes among intervention groups, as compared to controls, in interpersonal skills, peer and adult relationships, self-control and problem solving.26 Researchers also found significant reductions in negative risk behaviors including drug use, aggressive behavior, truancy, and sexual risk-taking behavior. Among programs exhibiting positive outcomes, all incorporated 3 essential elements of the PYD construct, specifically, emotional competence, self-efficacy, and the development of prosocial norms.26

Preliminary evidence supports the application of SEL and PYD to youth risk behaviors. Youth involved in effective PYD and SEL programs experience significant gains in positive health outcomes and reductions in negative health behaviors indicating a natural application to bullying prevention programs grounded in these constructs. 25-27 TTL provides such a model, combining PYD and SEL frameworks in a curricular format, and is buttressed by social support systems (eg, faculty, parents). Although research linking SEL and PYD constructs to reductions in bullying is in its early stages, extant research of their effectiveness with related youth risk behaviors has been positive and sustainable.24-26 This research addresses a gap in the literature by examining the application of TTL, an SEL and PYD program, to school bullying.

TTL is a 16-lesson curriculum grounded in SEL and PYD theories. Developed by health promotion specialists, TTL is designed to increase the social competencies of participants on a broad spectrum of social skills including, self-awareness, self-management, social-awareness, relationship skills, decision making, problem solving, and leadership.16 TTL is designed to be taught during a regular class period (approximately 45 minutes), once per week for 16 weeks by classroom teachers trained by TTL trainers for a minimum of 6 hours. Each lesson includes a knowledge, skill, and application component providing participants the opportunity to apply practiced behaviors to real-world situations. For example, the Communication lesson begins with students brainstorming elements of effective communication, followed by individual and paired practice of different elements (eg, eye contact, listening, showing empathy), culminating in a personal interview with a classmate and parent that is later shared with the class.

An educational workshop is offered to all 7th grade parents by TTL trainers. A parent information letter, designed to keep parents apprised of ongoing lesson goals and activities is sent home at the beginning of each new segment. Corresponding lesson goals for the TTL program are presented in Table 1. For the purpose of this study, TTL is referred to as an intervention, as it is being assessed for its impact on bullying behavior change from pretest to posttest.

A quantitative pretest-posttest control group cohort study design was used to measure for changes in bully and victim behavior among a sample of suburban 7th grade students participating in TTL. The first step was to select a study population able and willing to meet implementation criteria including: (1) commitment to full-scale implementation of TTL (1 day/week for sixteen 45-minute lessons), (2) approvals for whole-grade level implementation, and (3) commitment to faculty and administrator training (minimum of 6 hours) for staff involved in implementation. Research coincided with state mandates to improve existing bullying identification and prevention programing, as levels of self-reported bullying in Connecticut reflected increasing national trends.28 Four public middle schools in close proximity to the research site were invited to participate. One school met the aforementioned criteria; the remaining 3 schools met 1 or none of the criteria.

Participation in the 16-session TTL intervention was the independent variable; bullying and victimization were the 2 dependent variables under investigation. The TTL intervention was measured by participation in at least 13 of the 16 lessons. Teachers, who kept participant attendance, asked students who had missed more than 3 sessions not to complete the posttest, resulting in missing data which was dropped from the study. Dependent variables were measured by the Peer Relations Questionnaire (PRQ), a 12-item self-report survey which has been used cross-nationally to assess bullying and victim behaviors.29

All 7th grade students enrolled and attending one suburban public middle school in southwestern Connecticut participated in TTL as part of a district-approved SEL initiative. The sample was drawn from a predominantly White suburban town of approximately 19,000 residents located in southwestern Connecticut. The racial demographic of the 7th grade sample population was 93% White, 1% African American, 2% Latino/Hispanic, and 3% Asian.

After receiving district and parental approvals (parents could opt children out of participation), 32 classrooms, representing the entire 7th grade student body (N = 336), were randomly assigned to participate in either the fall 2009 or spring 2010 TTL intervention. This 45-minute period was allocated as a “workshop” period for all 7th graders. Those selected for fall 2009 intervention received TTL for the first semester “workshop,” then attended study hall during the spring 2010 “workshop.” Those selected for spring 2010 intervention attended study hall during the fall 2009 “workshop,” then received TTL second semester (spring 2010). The spring 2010 cohort acted as controls during the fall 2009 intervention, as they received no intervention during this time, and their teachers were not trained until the spring 2010 intervention.

Prior to, and at completion of each intervention, students anonymously completed the PRQ, a self-report survey that provides a sum score for bullying (perpetration) and victimization (target) behaviors.29 Questionnaires took approximately 15 minutes to complete, and were completed at 3 assessment points: T1: commencement of fall 2009 intervention; T2: completion of fall 2009 intervention, and T3: completion of spring 2010 intervention. Numerically coded questionnaires were distributed and collected by teachers trained in TTL. Responses were assigned numeric values according to PRQ scoring instructions. Data were cleaned for abnormalities and missing data, then analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences-18 (IBM, Armonk, NY).

The PRQ is a 12-item self-report survey designed to measure the frequency and array of bullying and victimization among adolescents. Within this study, bullying was operationalized and measured by the PRQ as the intentional, repeated physical, verbal, or relational harm perpetrated by an individual or group of persons, to another (victim).30 Victimization was defined as the target or recipient of the aforementioned intentional and repeated harm.30 The PRQ contains a global measure and separate subscales for bullying and victimization, including physical (hitting and kicking), verbal (teasing and name calling), and relational (excluding others). Bully and victim statements are presented in the first person, with four multiple choice response options. For example, “I am part of a group that teases others,” is one of the 4 statements comprising the bullying subscale. For each behavior queried, multiple choice responses include “never = 0,” “once in a while = 1,” “pretty often = 2,” and “very often = 3.” Sum scores for each subscale (bully, victim) range between 0 and 12, measured on a 4-point Likert-type scale.

The PRQ has demonstrated moderate to strong reliability, validity, and internal consistency as a measure of bullying and victimization among youth populations in large- and small-scale cross-national comparisons.31-33 In a study of the psychometric properties of bullying self-report surveys, the PRQ showed internal consistencies and test-retest reliability among 3rd through 11th graders testing and retesting with the PRQ over an 8-week period (69.4% correspondence), and strong internal consistencies (89% correspondence).32 Australian researchers found adequate internal consistencies for the separate measures within the PRQ among school children aged 12 to 18 (N = 1162); victim scale (α coefficient: .86 for school A; .78 for school B) and bully scale (α coefficient: .75 for school A; .78 for school B).33 Validity was examined in a correlational study of the self-report PRQ using peer nomination; findings indicated correlations of .45 for boys (N = 393); .41 for girls (N = 347) with p < .001.33 The PRQ was selected for this study as it adequately assessed for changes in dependent variables using a standardized instrument that was readily implemented by classroom teachers, and was linked to social interactions addressed in the TTL intervention.

Sum scores for each dependent variable were compared for change from pretest to posttest for control and intervention cohorts. Means and standard deviations for summed scores were calculated, and ANOVA was used to test for measurable differences in bullying and victimization. To examine where mean differences lie within the interaction, a post hoc test consisting of 2 dependent and 2 independent t tests was conducted. To examine if differences exist for different assessment points (1 vs 2 vs 3) a repeated measures analyses of variance was conducted, followed by a Bonferroni post hoc test which examined specifically where mean differences lie within the established interaction. To measure for the impact of sex on the outcome variables ANCOVA was used.

Descriptive statistics are presented for each study variable. The independent variable, participation in TTL, showed a 96% response rate; 323 of the original sample of 336 7th-grade students provided complete pretest-posttest data. The mean age of respondents was 12.2 years. The racial demographic of the 7th grade sample population was 93% White, 1% African American, 2% Latino/Hispanic, and 3% Asian. Missing data were equally distributed among boys (N = 6) and girls (N = 7). During the fall 2009 intervention, 160 intervention and 163 controls provided complete data sets, with fairly even sex participation, 87 girls and 73 boys in the intervention group and 84 girls and 79 boys in the control group. During the spring 2010 intervention, the 163 controls received the intervention; 84 girls and 79 boys.

Tables 2 and 3 present the analyses of the impact of TTL on self-reported bullying as measured by the PRQ. At program outset (T1), sum scores for bullying behaviors were similar among intervention and control groups, p = .188 (Table 2). ANOVA revealed an interaction between assessment point and group that was significant, F(1,321) = 45.17, p < .001. To examine where mean differences lie within the interaction, post hoc t tests were conducted. Results revealed significant difference in mean bully sum scores (p < .001) at posttest (T2) between the intervention group, whose mean score dropped from 1.15 (1.47) to 0.68 (SD = 1.04) compared to the control group, whose mean score increased to 1.98 (SD = 2.02) over the same time period (Table 3). Within-group comparisons indicated that students taking part in the intervention had a significant decrease in self-reported bullying from pretest to posttest, while controls, who did not receive any intervention, reported increasing bullying behavior during this same time period.

Results for the spring 2010 intervention indicated similar decreases in bullying behavior, as controls receiving the intervention reported significant bullying reductions (Table 3). Repeated measures ANOVA for the 3 assessment points (1 vs 2 vs 3) revealed significant difference in bullying F(2,324) = 18.41, p < .001. Bonferroni post hoc test suggests that bullying increased during the period of no intervention (Assessment point I to Assessment Point II), then decreased significantly following intervention (Assessment Point III).

With regard to boy and girl bullying, results of participation in TTL remained significant after controlling for sex. The interaction between group and assessment point after controlling for sex was significant, F(1,320) = 29.93, p = .001. As indicated in Table 3, post hoc t tests by sex mimicked the results shown by the groups as a whole. For the intervention group, significant bullying reductions were reported among boys and girls; with mean sum scores decreasing among boys from 1.53 (1.47) to 0.88 (1.26) from pretest to posttest, and 0.84 (1.07) to 0.52 (0.80) among girls. Among controls, an initial increase in bully sum scores from Assessment Points I to II was seen for boys and girls, followed by a significant reduction in self-reported scores after participation in TTL, at Assessment Point III.

Results of self-reported victim behaviors are presented in Tables 2 and 4, including analyses of the impact of TTL on self-reported victimization as measured by the PRQ. At program outset (T1), sum scores for victimization differed between intervention and control groups, p = .001 (Table 2); at pretest the intervention group had a larger mean (Mean = 2.48, SD = 2.55) compared to the control group (Mean = 1.41, SD = 1.94). ANOVA revealed an interaction between assessment point and group that was significant, F(1,321) = 58.12, p < .001. To examine where mean differences lie within the interaction, post hoc t tests were conducted. Significant differences in mean victim sum scores (p < .001) at posttest (T2) were found between the intervention group, whose mean score dropped from 2.48 (2.55) to 1.26 (1.80) compared to the control group, whose mean score increased from 1.41 (1.94) to 2.25 (2.40) over the same time period (Table 4). Within group comparisons indicated that students taking part in the intervention had a significant decrease in self-reported victimization from pretest to posttest.

Results for the spring 2010 intervention indicated similar decreases in victimization as controls receiving the intervention reported reduced victimization. ANOVA for the 3 assessment points (1 vs 2 vs 3) revealed significant difference in victimization, F(2,324) = 21.83, p < .001. Bonferroni post hoc test suggests that victimization among controls increased during the period of no intervention (Assessment Point I to Assessment Point II), then decreased significantly following intervention (Assessment Point III).

With regard to boy and girl victimization, results of participation in TTL remained significant after controlling for sex. The interaction between group and assessment point after controlling for sexes was significant, F(1,320) = 57.96, p = .001. As indicated in Table 4, post hoc t tests by sex mimicked the results shown by the groups as a whole. For the intervention group, self-reported victimization was significantly reduced among boys and girls; with mean sum scores decreasing from 2.55 (2.56) to 1.35 (1.79) among boys from pretest to posttest, and 2.41 (2.55) to 1.18 (1.81) among girls. Among controls, an initial increase in victim sum scores from Assessment Points I to II was seen for boys and girls, followed by significant reductions in self-reported scores after participation in TTL at Assessment Point III.

The current research, although limited by design, supports the application of PYD and SEL to school bullying. It is beyond the scope of this study to posit the specific mechanisms of actualization from theory to practice; however, significant reductions for self-reported bullying and victimization coincided with participation in the 16-session asset-based program. Our findings support extant findings that a shift to strength-based programming may be meaningful to youth due to its emphasis on “catching youth doing good,” and therefore, may be more readily adopted than traditional deficit-based or targeted “bully” interventions.25, 26 TTL's focus on improving social skills both inside and outside the classroom provided opportunities for application of acquired positive behaviors among and between social groups throughout the semester long intervention; an approach that has been associated with reductions in related negative outcomes.27, 34 Given the spectrum of interaction among middle schoolers, including the increasing scope and breadth of school bullying, the acquisition of prosocial skills imparted through the implementation of youth development programs such as TTL, may mitigate the expression of bully behaviors.

The study raises important questions for future research and fuels the need for expanded evaluation of TTL. For example, unforeseen escalation of bullying and victimization among controls raises questions about the reliability of results and underscores the need for further evaluation. Were reductions in bullying among controls inflated due to sharp increases prior to their time-lag intervention? Although deterioration of social behaviors during the middle school years is supported by research,18, 35 we need to determine if these trajectories of adolescent behaviors are amenable to sustainable change. If these trajectories of behavior are naturally occurring, how should prevention and intervention programs be adapted to promote maximum reduction in negative behaviors for all students?

Also worthy of further consideration is the contribution of school selection, faculty training, administrative support, and parent education to program impact. Finding a school that met all criteria for participation was challenging, yet social supports have been identified as key contributors to program fidelity, student participation, and classroom climate. The extent and specificity of their impact on the current study requires further examination.

This study contributes to bullying literature and youth development theories, yet several issues limit study findings. First, the small and homogenous sample limits the generalizability of results beyond participants in this study. Lack of a comparison group from a separate but comparable community increases the potential for contamination, limiting internal validity. The short-term study design (16 weeks/1 semester) limits our knowledge of sustainability of results and long-term impact. Reliability of findings are hindered by self-reporting, which relies on the honesty, comprehension, and recall of the reporter.36, 37 Social desirability may have skewed results for participants who chose to report desirable responses regarding personal behaviors. Finally, instrumentation limited the precision, clarity, and standardization of results. The PRQ does not identify all areas of bullying, and is vague in its measurement of number of bullying episodes. Additional measures of bullying, such as peer nomination and teacher observation, in conjunction with self-reporting, would strengthen the research design.

In spite of these limitations, this study reinforces the importance and utility of examining alternative bullying interventions grounded in SEL and PYD constructs. Ideally, future studies should include large, diverse populations with adequate comparison groups, followed longitudinally. More than one indicator of bullying behavior should be used, and additional risk factors and demographics considered.

As the rate of school bullying remains unacceptably high, the examination of intervention initiatives must remain a research priority. The development of social competencies provides a lens to reducing bullying that is inclusive and readily adopted by classroom teachers. We must thoughtfully and collaboratively adjust our focus to make room for alternatives that develop prosocial skill-sets among all students. Educators, school counselors, and other school professionals can use these results to enhance existing bullying reduction efforts, promote a positive school climate, and broaden the scope of available alternatives for addressing this growing public health problem.
