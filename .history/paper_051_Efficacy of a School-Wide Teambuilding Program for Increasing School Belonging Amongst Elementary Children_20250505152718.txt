ABSTRACT
School belonging is a construct that describes student connections to school via a
student‟s social and emotional attachments to others at school, commitment to adhering
to school rules, involvement in school activities, and belief systems related to how much
school is valued (Hirschi, 1969; Wehlage et al, 1989). Research has consistently found
connections between higher levels of school belonging and more favorable life outcomes
in regard to academics, behavior, attendance, school completion, and mental health.
Research has also provided suggestions regarding components that should be present for
programs to effectively enhance school belonging. Despite this, few research-based
programs exist that have been designed specifically to address this construct. This study
examined the efficacy of components of a new school-wide teambuilding program, titled
Project: TEAM, for improving school belonging amongst elementary-age children

following one school year of implementation. In addition, the study examined the
differential effects of the program based on student grade level and gender. Pre- and
post-intervention surveys of school belonging were collected from 137 students at an
intervention (n = 82) and a comparison (n = 55) school in south-central Pennsylvania.
The results of a repeated-measures ANOVA found no significant difference in school
belonging between students at the intervention versus comparison school. Follow-up
independent sample t-tests revealed that students at the comparison school reported
significantly higher levels of school belonging than students at the intervention school at
baseline but not on post-surveys. Thus, the components of Project: TEAM appeared to
have assisted students at the intervention school with closing the gap in reported levels of
school belonging that was identified on baseline surveys. Additional analyses indicated
no significant difference in reports of school belonging based on grade level; however,
male students did report significantly higher levels of school belonging than female
students. Though most results in this study were not significant and effect sizes were
small, the study provided preliminary evidence suggesting that the efficacy of Project:
TEAM for improving school belonging should be examined further on a longitudinal
basis. Implications of the findings, as well as limitations and recommendations for future
research are considered

Introduction
During the past few decades, research has begun to examine the influence of
various school climate variables on student personal and academic outcomes. One
particular variable that has repeatedly been linked to positive student outcomes
throughout the literature is a student‟s sense of connectedness or belonging within the
school setting. In general, students who have a higher sense of belonging in school tend
to have more favorable personal and school outcomes (Anderman, 2002; Benner,
Graham, & Mistry, 2008; Catalano & Hawkins, 1996; Faircloth & Hamm, 2005; Finn,
1989; Furrer & Skinner, 2003; Goodenow, 1993; Goodenow & Grady, 1993; Hagborg,
1994, 1998; Hirschi, 1969; Murray & Greenberg, 2000, 2001; Osterman, 2000; Wehlage,
1989; Wehlage, Rutter, Smith, Lesko, & Fernandez, 1989).
In the current age of high-stakes testing, many school administrators feel
pressured to focus instruction solely on academics, not recognizing that students‟ sense of
belonging to school is a pivotal factor for increasing student success in general (Catalano,
Haggerty, Oesterle, Fleming, & Hawkins, 2004). Amongst other things, a significant link
has been established between children‟s sense of connectedness in school and various
academic (Benner et al., 2008; Faircloth & Hamm, 2005; Goodenow, 1993; Goodenow &
Grady, 1993; Hagborg, 1998; Osterman, 2000), behavioral (Catalano & Hawkins, 1996;
Hirschi, 1969; Murray & Greenberg, 2000, 2001), and mental health outcomes
(Anderman, 2002; Furrer & Skinner, 2003; Hagborg, 1994; Murray & Greenberg, 2000,
2001). In addition, research suggests that the level of belonging that a student feels
PREVIEW

within the school setting is directly associated with a student‟s likelihood of completing
high school (Finn, 1989; Wehlage, 1989; Wehlage et al., 1989).
Unfortunately, despite a preponderance of evidence suggesting the benefits of all
students experiencing a strong sense of school belonging, few programs seeking
specifically to increase student belonging exist within the literature, and many schools
continue to enforce policies that deter students from developing attachments within the
school setting (Osterman, 2000; Wehlage et al., 1989).
Student Connections with School
A variety of terminology and definitions have been used throughout the previous
literature to describe constructs related to school bonding (Furlong, Whipple, St. Jean,
Simental, Soliz, & Punthana, 2003; Goodenow, 1993; Hirschi, 1969; Jimerson, Campos,
& Grief, 2003; Libbey, 2004; O‟Farrelll & Morrison, 2003; Wehlage et al., 1989).
Researchers have referred to constructs related to school bonding by various names,
including school attachment, school connection, school engagement, school belonging,
school involvement, school membership, school climate, student satisfaction with school,
positive orientation to school, and student identification with school (Libbey, 2004;
Goodenow, 1993). Researchers have studied the plethora of terminology, definitions,
and measurements used to assess the constructs related to school bonding (Jimerson et
al., 2003; O‟Farrell & Morrison, 2003), but ultimately Libbey (2004) determined that no
one school bonding construct is superior to others in regard to how it was labeled,
defined, or measured.
For the purposes of this dissertation, student sense of connectedness to school will
be referred to as “school belonging.” Based on Wehlage et al.‟s (1989) definition of
PREVIEW

“school membership”, school belonging will be defined in this dissertation as a 4-part
construct, consisting of 1) attachments, or student social and emotional connections with
others in the school; 2) commitment, or the desire to conform with school rules and
expectations even if they are not appealing; 3) involvement, or engagement in school
activities; and 4) beliefs, or a student‟s feelings that school is valuable and worthwhile.
Previous research suggests that student levels of school connectedness may vary
by gender (Furrer & Skinner, 2003; Goodenow, 1003; Griner Hill & Werner, 2006;
Hagborg, 1994), and they may change throughout the course of a child‟s education, with
sense of belonging decreasing as children progress from elementary to secondary school
(Anderman, 2003; Furrer & Skinner, 2003; Mitchell, 2008). Although school belonging
tends to decline as children get older, with drastic decreases once students enter
secondary school, research suggests that schools must implement interventions to target
school belonging at the elementary level, prior to the decline commencing, in order to
maximize school belonging and its associated outcomes (Hawkins, Guo, Hill, BattinPearson, & Abbott, 2001; Mitchell, 2008).
Improving School Belonging
In the recent decade, researchers have begun to examine how various programs
and frameworks can be used to enhance social, emotional, and behavioral functioning at
the school-wide level. School-wide Positive Behavior Support (SWPBS), also referred to
at times as Positive Behavior Support (PBS) or Positive Behavior Interventions and
Supports (PBIS), has been one of the most researched frameworks for this type of change
(Barret, Bradshaw, & Lewis-Palmer, 2008; Office of Special Education Programs
[OSEP], 2009; Sugai et al., 2000).

While SWPBS is not a specific program or intervention in and of itself, the model
provides a framework for providing various levels of interventions in order to optimize
the academic, social, emotional, and behavioral success of all students (OSEP, 2009).
Interventions are separated into three different tiers, with tier one interventions being
provided to all students school-wide, tier two interventions being provided to smaller
groups of approximately 5-10% of the population who did not respond to tier one
interventions alone, and tier three interventions being reserved for a small group of only
1-5% of students who did not sufficiently respond to tier one or tier two interventions
(McEvoy, 2010-2011; Sugai et al., 2000).
Research specific to school belonging suggests that programs designed to enhance
students‟ sense of belonging at school must focus on building relationships amongst
students and teachers (Furrer & Skinner, 2003). Programs must also consider the social
culture of the school (Walker & Greene, 2009; Zeichner, 1978), encourage parental
involvement (Benner, Graham, & Mistry, 2008), encourage student participation in
school activities (Finn, 1989), incorporate rituals specific to that school (Mullis &
Fincher, 1996), and emphasize a sense of community amongst students (McMillan &
Chavis, 1986). Furthermore, efforts must be made for all students – especially those who
are considered to be at risk – to be embraced and assimilated into the school community
(Wehlage, 1989).
A review of existing literature provides limited information regarding schoolbased programs that are designed to enhance school belonging. Two of the most wellestablished and researched examples of programs designed to enhance school belonging
are the Seattle Social Development Project (SSDP) and its successor, Raising Healthy
PREVIEW

Children (RHC). Both programs were designed by the Social Development Research
Group and are aimed at improving a variety of student outcomes by addressing both
protective and risk factors that are deemed important for individual development
(Catalano, Haggerty, Oesterle, Fleming, & Hawkins, 2004). The programs consider
attachments with and commitment to prosocial school, peers, and family; as well as
clearly defined standards for behaviors to be primary protective factors for influencing
healthy student outcomes. Research has shown that both programs resulted in
improvements in student commitment to school following one year of intervention
(Catalano et al, 2004; Catalano, Mazza, Harachi, Abbott, Haggerty, & Fleming, 2003);
however, longitudinal studies suggest that it is imperative for interventions to begin when
children are in early elementary school (Hawkins et al., 2001; Mitchell, 2008) and for the
interventions to continue throughout their schooling in order to result in long-term
increases in school belonging and associated positive outcomes (Hawkins et al., 2001).
Although not yet empirically studied, there is an emerging school-wide program,
referred to as Project: TEAM that was designed to improve students‟ sense of belonging
at the elementary level (Covert, 2010). While Project: TEAM incorporates some
components that are similar in nature to the SSDP and RHC, such as encouraging parent
involvement, providing teachers with strategies for enhancing classroom management
and providing cooperative learning experiences, and teaching students appropriate
interpersonal skills (Catalano et al., 2004; Covert, 2010); the program offers several
unique features that distinguish it from prior programs of this nature (Covert, 2010).

Project: TEAM
Project: TEAM is a school-wide program designed to enhance student
connections to school by utilizing a team-building approach. The program was inspired
by theories related to sports psychology and adventure-based counseling, and as such,
there is a heavy emphasis on the development of leadership and problem-solving skills.
Project: TEAM focuses on the development of six foundational skills, which include
helping others, anti-bullying, resiliency, positive changes in behavior, problem
solving/conflict resolution, and leadership (Covert, 2010). Consistent with literature
suggesting that social and behavioral skills must be directly taught and practiced (Lewis,
Sugai, & Colvin, 1998), the foundations of Project: TEAM are explicitly taught to
students via classroom lessons, as well as during various assemblies and Project: TEAM
activities. Each lesson is also accompanied by collaborative team-building activities to
provide practice in the target skills (Covert, 2010).
A review of the relevant literature suggests that unlike any previously researched
program designed specifically to enhance sense of belonging to school, Project: TEAM
aligns closely with a SWPBS framework (OSEP, 2009), providing interventions to
students at three different tier levels depending on student need. Project: TEAM is
designed to further develop the interpersonal and problem-solving skills of all students
while simultaneously taking students who are at-risk for social, emotional, or behavioral
problems and placing them into a position of leadership in order to further develop their
skills in the areas of need. In essence, one goal of Project: TEAM is to embrace even the
most at-risk children in the school by letting them know that they have valuable
contributions to make to the entire school community. This approach prevents the
