Introduction
In the modern world, advances and changes experienced in social, political, and economic
domains have not been effective in diminishing the unwanted behaviors displayed by individuals in
the society. Although primary education seems to be successful in a systematic sense, increasing
violence in society and behaviors that students demonstrate both in and out of school such as temper
tantrums, intolerance, violence trends, and attempts to resolve problems with violent methods and
insults prove that individuals can not be sufficiently furnished with expected positive behaviors. This
underpins the need for creating a peace culture based on education. Schools are undoubtedly the
starting point for this and can help make this change through peace education (Demir, 2011).
Peace education was born out of peace studies with different subfields like “global security,
human rights education and environmental education” (Bajaj & Chiu, 2009). UNICEF defines peace
education as the promotion of “knowledge, skills, attitudes and values” to create behavioral change in
children, young people, and grown-ups, in order to prevent overt as well as structural conflict and
violence. Peace education allows individuals to peacefully solve conflict and to help create peaceful
conditions at intrapersonal, interpersonal, intergroup, national or global levels”(Fountain, 1999; United
Nations, 1998).

Peace education must address the prevention and resolution of all forms of conflict and
violence, whether overt or structural, from the interpersonal level to the societal and global level
(Fountain, 1999). Also, peace education is most effective when the skills of peace and conflict resolution
are learned actively and are modeled by the school environment in which they are taught (Baldo &
Furniss, 1998). It is suggested that since peace is so important, it is advisable to start introducing it to
our children through the study of peace education in our schools. Peace education is a right of all
children, not only those living in situations of armed conflict. It is a long-term process that can take place
in any learning environment.
Over the years, different approaches to peace education have been adopted. Both discourses
and practices conclude in divergent views over which contents and methods in peace education to
prioritize (Haavelsrud & Stenberg, 2012). Some focus more on conflict resolution skills while other on
non-violent skills, communication skills and promoting peaceful attitudes. Schools are social sites where
violence is witnessed in different forms. However, it negatively affects the learning and teaching culture
(Zulu et al., 2004). The aim of peace education is to remove negative feelings by creating a forum for
people to come together and allow them to know, trust, and cooperate with each other, and thus coexist
(Agarwal, 2011).
Peace education includes education on international relations, human rights, developmental
psychology, the environment and conflict resolution. Non violence and peace building are so strong
that they empower individuals and give them solidarity (Robertson, Dale & Novelli, 2007). Peace
education consists of different components and skills. The most important of these components are
conflict resolution and communication skills (Klemp, 2000), which play a complex role in people’s lives
and are experienced at the personal as well as social level. Sociologists state that conflicts are essential
for social change to take place, and some social theorists, like Dahrendorf (as cited by Harris & Morrison,
2003), believe “that conflict resolution is a myth because social conflicts are inherent in the very nature
of social organization and structure”. However, peace educators focus on the value as well as risks of
conflict and aim to increase the communication skills.
Conflict is also considered to be an opportunity for growth and problem-solving and its origins
can be analyzed at individual and societal level (Morrison, Austad & Cota, 2011). Similarly, the ability
to effectively communicate with other people is an important skill. People who communicate effectively
know how to interact with others flexibly, skillfully, and responsibly, but without sacrificing their own
needs and integrity (Richard, 2002). Abilities related to communication skills include listening and
speaking behavior which makes it possible to effectively share facts and feelings, that is, listening to
understand, speaking to be understood, and using neutral utterances instead of “emotionally charged
statements” (Bodine & Crawford, 1999). In peace education, the ability to communicate with others and
to resolve conflicts effectively are two of the most important life skills for individuals to develop because
it allows them to become more equipped for success both in life and personal relationships. Effective
conflict resolution and communication skills can be learned through education.
Several studies have addressed the effect of PEP on conflict resolution and communication
skills. Danesh (2006) found that the implementation of a PEP was effective on the student’s culture of
peace, cultural optimism and Danesh and Clarke-Habibi (2008), state that enrolling students in a PEP
helps them to solve their social problems and conflicts creatively. Shapiro et al. (2002), show that
teaching a PEP decreased aggressive behavior of students and demonstrated that there was significant
improvement in their conflict resolution skills. Maxwell et al. (2004), in a study of ‘the development and
evaluation of a South African peace education program at pre-school level’ also obtained strong
evidence that a PEP decreased aggressive behavior among the children of the target population. The
results also indicated that the teacher development course for PEP was well received by the teachers
and helped them develop in different areas. The study also showed that peace education can have a
considerable positive impact in a country that is recovering from years of political and social violence.

Sertel et al. (2004) found that teaching a PEP had a significant effect on conflict resolution in
interpersonal relations and communication skills. Sagkal (2011), too, shows that the teaching of PEP has
an effect on the student’s aggressive tendencies, empathy levels and views of peace. As well as most
studies show that the implementation of a PEP can be effective on the communication and problem
solving skills, anger management, decision-making and use of the constructive conflict resolution
techniques of students (Harris, 2003; Lane-GAron & Richardson, 2003; Martin et al. 2002; Mutluoglu &
Serin, 2012; Palmer & Roessler, 2001; Stevahn, 2004; Tapan, 2006). It is also reported to promote positive
feelings and thoughts about peace (Kadivar, 2007; Spears, 2004).
Since bullying and youth violence is a prevalent problem in many schools, including conflict
resolution and peace education programs in the school curriculum may be a direct way to solve this
issue. However, constructively resolving conflict is mostly not included in the early years of the public
school’s curriculum (Anyon, 1979; Apple, 1979; Ehman, 1980; Malott & Porfilio, 2011; McNeil, 1986;
Ndura-Ouédraogo & Amster, 2009). Yet, evidence suggests that the problem of youth violence and
bullying can be mitigated by offering conflict resolution and peace education programs. The focus of
this study is to gain a holistic understanding of students’ views on what they learned from participating
and teaching in a peace education program. The study was based upon the principles of moral inclusion
and also contributes to a substantial amount of especially quantitative data regarding the actual effects
and impacts of PEP.
Purpose of The Study
While conflicts are an inevitable part of social relations, the response to conflict can be either
destructive or constructive (Deutsch, 1993). Conflict in schools in its destructive form of bullying and
violence, fomented by prejudices among diverse groups, is a fact of life that students face daily.
Bombarded with modern media everywhere they look, children see numerous acts of violence. The
problem is that young people can see violence and bullying as a normative conflict resolution strategy.
Therefore, there is an urgent need for alternative education programs such as peace education, and not
only for students, but for all other strata of society as well. This study aims to generate knowledge and
to add new information to the current research about peace education processes. Accordingly, the aim
of this study is to examine the effects of a PEP on the conflict resolution and communication skills of
secondary school seventh-grade students.
Method
Participants
A pretest-posttest control group quasi-experimental design was used in this study. The study
group of this research was secondary school students in the seventh grade (2013-2014 academic year) of
a public secondary school located on the Çankaya district in Ankara, Turkey from middle socioeconomic class. Four seventh grade classes (n=70) were randomly selected. The students in the four
classes that joined the study were divided into two groups. The experimental group (n=35) was
subjected to treatment, that is, they received PEP; the control group (n=35) did not receive PEP. All
students in the experimental group participated in the program, regardless of their initial attitudes
toward participation. They all obtained school consent to participate in this program as part of their
extracurricular school activities.

Materials
In this study, in order to gather the required data, the Scale to Determine Conflict Resolution
Behaviors and the Scale of Communication Skills were administered to both groups to examine the
effectiveness of the experimental treatment. These instruments were chosen as they are the most widely
used scales and appropriate for this age group. They are reliable, prepared according to the culture of
the target population and recommended by experts in the field.
Scale to Determine the Conflict Resolution Behaviors: This scale was developed by Koruklu (1998)
and is a self-rating scale, the completion of which takes approximately 20 minutes. The scale is
appropriate for use with children aged 10-15. The scale includes 24 five-point likert-type items. It
consists of two sub-scales: Aggressive Behavior and Problem-Solving. In terms of conflict resolution, a
high score on the aggressive sub-scale has a negative meaning. Conversely, a high score on the problemsolving sub-scale has a positive meanings. The scale includes separate questions for each sub-scale and
the sub-scale scores are calculated independently. The reliability coefficient were calculated for each
sub-scale: Aggression sub-scale .85 and conflict resolution sub-scale to be .83. Also, content validity was
calculated by expert opinions and construct validity was calculated by factor analysis to be over .40.
Scale of Communication Skills: This scale was developed by Ersanlı and Balcı (1998) and revised
by Karatekin et al. (2012) for 6th, 7th and 8th grade secondary school students. The scale has three
dimensions (Cognitive, Emotional, and Behavioral) and measures the communication skills from
cognitive, emotional and behavioral aspects. It consists of 34 five-point likert-type items. The total scores
are calculated for the communication skill a whole and for the separate dimensions. The reliability
coefficient was calculated to be .88. The content validity was calculated by expert opinions.
Procedure and PEP Context
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a developed PEP on secondary
school seventh-grade students’ conflict resolution and communication skills. Therefore, a PEP was
prepared, implemented and tested. The program was prepared by the researcher under the supervision
of five professors in educational science especially in the field of conflict resolution and peace education.
It was designed based on other programs used in Turkey and abroad, such as the WINPACE, the peace
education program of the Bogazici University Peace Education Center, the UNICEF peace education
programs, Harvard University Peace Education Program, and Peace Schools Peace Cerculia.
Then, the 12 session PEP (one-hour session per week) was implemented in one academic
semester in the experimental group. In each session, first, previous assignments and homework were
shared and questions discussed by volunteers. Then new information was given to the class about the
new activity. After the activity, a new homework was given to the students and the session ended. No
treatment was provided to the classes in the control group. Before and after the experimental treatment,
the Scale to Determine Conflict Resolution Behaviors and Scale of Communication Skills were
administered to the experimental and control groups as pre-test and post-test. The participants
answered the research questionnaire one week before the first session (pre-test) and one week after the
last session (post-test). In addition, three months after completion of the PEP, both scales were
administered again to both groups as a follow up to examine the stability effect of the PEP. The
participants’ anonymity was ensured. In order to equate groups in pre-test, data analysis was achieved
through Covariance statistical test (ANCOVA). For analysis of quantitative data, the SPSS was used.
PEP sessions were as follows: 1) Introduction, aim and content of the program, class regulations;
2) Information on peace, awareness of internal and external factors hindering and supporting peace; 3)
Expressing feelings, its importance and use in daily life; 4) Awareness of different values and individual
prejudices, empathy, understanding another; 5) Understanding and respecting individual differences;
6) Understanding stereotypes, empathizing with groups subject to stereotyping; 7) Information on
conflict, its reasons, and levels; 8) Understanding negotiation, its methods and use; 9) Understanding
communication and barriers to communication; 10) Understanding the concept of perception and its
role in conflict; 11) Definition of effective listening, how to achieve it, “I language” versus “you
language”, and adopting I language and 12) Program evaluation and end.

Results
The main aim of the present study was to examine the impact of a PEP on the student’s conflict
resolution and communication skills. To facilitate understanding of the results of this study, the research
question of this study was divided under two hypotheses.
First hypothesis: Training in the peace education program will enhance conflict resolution skills
in seventh-grade students. To test this hypothesis, comparison of group means and standard deviations
on the pre-test and post-test were employed. The results are shown in Table 2.

Experiment 35 39.17 10.87 35 40.29 8.80
Table 2 shows that there is no significant difference between the experimental and control group
in the two sub-scales of conflict resolution behaviors (aggression and problem-solving) in the pre-test.
However, it shows that there is a significant difference between the experimental and control groups in
the two sub-scales of conflict resolution behaviors (aggression and problem-solving) in the post-test
(p<.005). The mean difference is higher for the experimental group for the aggression sub-scale (𝑋=
29.51) and problem solving sub-scale (𝑋 =49.29). Thus, these results show that particpation in the PEP
enhances conflict resulotion skills in the seventh-grade school students in the experimental group. In
addition to this finding, three months after completion of the PEP, a follow-up measurement was
administered. The results show that three months after the teaching of the PEP, there also was a
significant diffrence between the experimental and control group, and the positive impact of the PEP
on conflict resolution was stable (for the aggression sub-scale: 𝑋= 30.55 and for the problem-solving
sub-scale: 𝑋= 47.52).

As shown in Table 3, after completion of the PEP, the average of the aggression levels of the
experimental group in the post-test were significantly lower than that of the control group for this subscale (F1-67=19.34 p= .000). In addition, the average of the problem solving skill levels in the
experimental group in the post-test was significantly higher than that of the control group for this subscale (F1-67=19.75, p= .000). This finding suggests that participation in the PEP enhanced conflict
resolution skills in the experimental group. Participants learned to understand the make-up of conflicts
that can both contribute to and have at their root miscommunication. Conflict is seen as an opportunity
for growth and for problem-solving.

The second hypothesis: Participation in the peace education progam will enhance communication
skills in seventh-grade students. To test this hypothesis, a comparison of group means and standard
deviations on the pre-test and post-test were used. The results are shown in Table 4.

Table 4 shows that there is no significant difference between experimental and control groups
with respect to scores on the three sub-dimensions (cognitive, behavioral and emotional dimensions) of
communication skills in the pre-test. However, it shows that there is a significant difference between
the experimental and control group with respect to the three sub-dimensions levels in communication
skills in the post-test (p<.005). The mean difference of the scores is higher for the experimental group in
communication skills (𝑋=131.37). These results show that participation in the PEP enhanced
communication skills in the experimental group. The PEP activities reinforced communication skills as
well as safety and community building. In addition, a follow-up measurement was administered. The
results show that at this stage, too, there was a significant diffrence between the experimental and
control group, and the positive impact of PEP on communication skills was stable (𝑋=120.55, 44.29,
41.65, 34.61).

As shown in Table 5, after completion of the PEP, the experimental group communication skills
levels average in the post-test was significantly higher than that of the control group in this scale (F1-

behavioral sub-dimension (F1-67=76.70, p= .000) and emotional sub-dimension (F1-67=59.13, p= .000). This

Discussion, Conclusion and Suggestions
At present the search for peace is considered a prerequisite for development, improved living
conditions, and the creation of better foundations for the future generations. In order to establish peace
in our domain, this study discusses the effect of peace education and the need to integrate this education
into school programs. In this manner, peace education can be provided vigorously, through practical
procedures and encouraging pupils to form acceptable habits of tolerance. The main aim of this study
was to examine the impact of a peace education program on the conflict resolution and communication
skills of seventh grade students. Findings showed that the PEP was effective in enhancing the conflict
resolution and communication skills in seventh-grade students.
This discussion is presented under the two main hypotheses: According to the first hypothesis,
this study explores whether there is a statistically significant difference between the control and
experimental groups in terms of the conflict resolution skills level after participation in the PEP. The
results indicate that the first hypothesis is supported; there was a significant difference between the
experimental and control group in conflict reolution skills levels after the the implementation of the
program. Thus, based on these findings, it can be concluded that following a PEP had a significant
impact on conflict resolution in seventh-grade students, decreasing their aggression level and increasing
their problem solving skills.
Secondly, this study aimed to explore whether there is a statistically significant difference
between the control and experimental groups in the communication skills level after completion of the
PEP. The results support the second hypthesis; there was a significant difference between the
experimental and control group in communication skills after the implementation of the program. So,
it can be concluded that training in the PEP had a significant impact on conflict resolution and
communication skills in seventh-grade students. The above findings are consistent with the literature
literature (Danesh, 2006; Danesh & Clarke-Habibi, 2008; Hariss, 2003; Lane et al, 2003; Martin et al. 2002;
Maxwell et al, 2004; Mutluoglu & Serin, 2012; Palmer & Roessler, 2001; Sagkal, 2011; Sertel & Kurt, 2004;
Stevhan, 2004; Tapan, 2006). The study also revealed the positive feelings and thoughts about peace.
The above findings are consistent with the literature (Kadivar, 2007; Maxwell et al, 2004; Spear, 2004).
Finally, it was also found that three months after completion of the PEP, there was a significant
difference between the experimental and control group in terms of conflict resolution and
communication skills, and the positive impact of PEP on conflict resolution and communication skills
was stable. Based on the findings, this study supports the notion that PEP is effective on changing
destructive strategies into constructive ones. The above findings are consistent with the literature
(Mutluoglu & Serin, 2012; Sagkal, 2011; Sertel & Kurt, 2004; Tapan, 2006). Consequently, this study
yields empirical evidence that may support changes in curricula and teacher training such that they
address students’ conflict resolution and communication skills. It also provides valuable data and
insights about peace education, as well as foundational research in the field, that serve as starting points
for applying and fully implementing critical education programs for other students, particularly in
secondary schools.
It is the responsibility of schools and teachers to be models of peaceful and non-violent behavior
to students. Not only should the content of the peace education curriculum deal with global issues and
peace-related content to provide learners with the opportunity to consider, understand and appreciate
others and to become part of a global civil society, but it should also provide learners with the necessary
skills to address problems that may arise. It is hoped that research can inform peace education curricula
in order to create a classroom environment that contributes to empowering learners successfully with
the necessary resources to create diverse pathways to sustainable peace. In order to achieve this, an
obvious starting point is teacher training programs. It has been argued that teacher training programs
should not only include content related to peace theory, conflict resolution and peace education, but
should also equip teacher trainees with the necessary knowledge and skills to reflect critically on their
own learning and that of their future learners. It is hoped that this will encourage teachers not to be

316
concerned not only with learners’ gaining communicative competence, but rather with learners’ gaining
communicative peace.
The struggle to achieve peace takes place at both the individual and social levels. Primarily
peace and conflict resolution programs enable schools to become safe places in which students relate to
each other in constructive ways and can learn. Moreover, children, adolescents and young adults are
socialized into the behaviors they will need to resolve conflicts constructively for their future lives
(Johnson & Johnson, 2004). Developing peace culture has led to a growth in tolerance and acceptance of
new practices and values: the words open, open-minded, understand and tolerant were used often to
describe how students felt their outlook had changed. The development and implementation of
cooperative active curricula might be useful for peace-building as well as creating a peace culture.
Educational efforts may be combined with the efforts of researchers and teachers to improve their
awareness about what is happening around them and in their own lives (Sadri-Damirchi et al. 2013). In
order to better manage efforts and help facilitate more lasting peace, international and regional
organisations need to clarify and improve their working principles and prevent disagreements and the
lack of coordination that hinder peacemaking. Thus, there is need to introduce the teaching of peace
education in schools by school counselor. This will enable adolescents to appreciate the relevance of
peace to their lives.
The current study was one of the first attempts to understand the effects of peace education on
the conflict resolution and communication skills of Turkish secondary (seventh-grade) students. Results
demonstrate that peace education had significant effects on student’s conflict resolution and
communication skills. The study revealed that peace is a global problem and so important that it
requires an integrated approach where counselors, teachers, parents and learners work together.
The concept of peace education, aims of peace education, suggested curriculum content of peace
education, modes of inclusion of peace education in the school curriculum and suggested strategies for
teaching peace education were discussed. Peace education is distinguished by the fact that it is not
limited to activities that take place in schools. A number of PEP have developed after-school
programmes and summer programmes with a peace education focus. Findings of this study are
considered to be helpful in directing teachers' and others related authorities' attention to peace and
conflict resolution education and in designing other studies with broader scopes.
Based on the findings, the following recommendations should be noted in order to provide PEP
in schools:
It is recommended that schools educate learners, educators and parents about conflict
resolution and effective communication skills. School counselors could conduct awareness seminars
and workshops on the above-mentioned forms of PEP. Learners should be taught to tolerate others
through teamwork during lessons.
Schools need to fulfill their role in promoting student’s conflict resolution and communication
skills through academic and training programs. It should be noted that the secondary school period is
critical and plays a critical role in acquisition of such skills. Therefore, more research is recommended
on the training of skills in secondary schools.
Peace education training program and classes at this age should be included in the regular
education courses. Peace education training can be integrated into the academic curriculum or they can
be taught separately. If they are given as stand-alone programs, they may lead to frustration and
overload for teachers. The integration of such programs into academic courses should be started in our
educational programs, as well.
The hope is shared that through education, people can develop certain thoughts and
dispositions that will lead to peaceful behavior. Key aspects of this disposition include kindness, critical
thinking, and cooperation. Developing such virtues is an important part of peace education
