The combination of native perennial plants bordering late-planted Vip3A X Cry1Ab Bt Protected Sweet Corn, Zea mays L. var saccharata, was used to examine populations of predaceous beneficial insects. Attribute II Aspire® containing both cry protein and vegetative insecticidal protein (VIP) and Honey Select® were the Bt and non-Bt sweet corn hybrids used, respectively, planted on June 17, 2021, at the Kentucky State University Harold R. Benson Research and Demonstration Farm, in Frankfort, Kentucky. A randomized complete block design with stratification was used with four replications and four treatments: two levels of border row treatment (pasture and native perennial) and two levels of corn hybrid treatment (Bt and non-Bt). Corn hybrids were randomized with respect to border row. Sixteen plots were created by splitting each of the eight larger existing plots 25 m × 10 m with a barren strip in between them and 2 m wide native perennial or pasture border rows. Yellow sticky traps 15 cm × 15 cm were deployed to trap beneficial insects. The traps were replaced weekly, and beneficial insects were identified. Fourteen species of beneficial insects were caught. The most abundant species was minute pirate bug, Orius sp., followed by pink lady beetle, Coleomegila maculata, multicolored Asian lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis, and big-eyed bug, Geocoris sp. Results will be discussed with respect to border type and corn hybrid.

Animal manure decomposition produce ammonia (NH3). NH3 reacts with water to form ammonium ions (NH4+) that quickly bind to the negatively charged soil organic matter and soil clays. In soil, NH4+ may be taken up by plant roots and transfer into nitrates (NO3-) that can also be absorbed by plants roots. A field experiment was conducted to study the impact of animal manures (sewage sludge SS, horse manure HM, chicken manure CM, vermicompost Vermi, commercial organic fertilizer Org, inorganic fertilizer Inorg, and no-manure NM native soil) on the concentrations of NH4+ and NO3- in the roots of three varieties of turnips, Brassica rapa. The three varieties were Purple Top White Globe PTWG, Scarlet Queen Red SQR, and Tokyo Cross TC. NH4+ and NO3- in turnip root extracts were determined using a Fisher brand XL500 Benchtop Meter equipped with Orion High-Performance ammonia and nitrate electrodes. Results revealed that the application of different animal manures is a major source of NH3 emission. The concentration of NH3 averaged 20.2, 12.8, and 8.9 µg g-1 fresh turnip roots, whereas NO3values averaged 107.6, 64.1, and 62.9 µg g-1 fresh turnip roots in varieties SQR, PTWG, and TC, respectively. Results also showed that Inorg, Vermi, and SS amended soil significantly increased NO3- concentrations in turnip roots compared to the roots of plants grown in control treatments.

Recently, an interest has developed in the rising commodity known as hemp. One way to improve the production of hemp is by applying amendments to soil such as rhizomicrobes (SoilCare). The objective of this study was to determine the impacts of different amounts of rhizomicrobes solution on hemp growth parameters, hemp yield, and soil properties. The experiment was conducted by Murray State University, in western Kentucky using CBD hemp that was planted in June 2020. The rhizomicrobes solution was applied prior to the planting of the hemp at the rates of 1 gal/acre (Treatment 1), 0.5 gal/acre (Treatment 2), 0.25 gal/acre (Treatment 3), as well as control. Measures used to track hemp growth included chlorophyll, true leaves, CBD content, height, and yield. Soil properties were examined to determine amounts of macronutrients, Cation Exchange Capacity, base saturation, pH and organic matter after harvesting with no replication. This research shows that the highest CBD level, yield, and chlorophyll was found in treatment three (0.25 gal/acre). The height of each hemp plot seemed to be similar to one another. During this first year study, soil fertility status was not largely affected by the rhizomicrobes application solutions. This experiment will be redone in the following years to obtain more in depth findings. It is expected that the use of rhizomicrobes will be beneficial for future CBD hemp management practices, because it allows the soil to be healthy and fertile therefore allowing sustainable hemp production to occur.

Soil biology and fertility are dependent on soil microorganisms that promote crop production through soil enzymatic activity, organic matter decay, and nutrient availability to growing plants. The objectives of this investigation were to: 1) assess the impact of soil amendments [sewage sludge (SS), horse manure (HM), chicken manure (CM), vermicompost (Vermi), commercial organic fertilizer (Org), inorganic fertilizer (Inorg)]; and no-mulch (NM) native soil on turnip root, shoot, and plant weight and 2) assess the impact of biochar added to SS, HM, CM, Vermi, Org, Inorg, and NM on the root, shoot, and plant weight of three varieties of turnips, Brassica rapa (Purple Top White Globe PTWG, Scarlet Queen Red SQR and Tokyo Cross PT) grown under field conditions. Results revealed that variety SQR significantly increased turnip root yield compared to the PTWG and TC varieties, whereas variety PTWG had the greatest shoot weight compared to SQR and TC. As a result, turnip varieties can be arranged based on total yield in a descending order as follows: SQR > PTWG > TC. Overall results also revealed that biochar added to SS, Org, Vermi, and HM significantly increased plant weight from 522.3, 482.5, 476.5, and 450.2 g to 737.5, 701.9, 673.3, and 640.8 g, respectively. We recommended the use of biochar for growing variety SQR in soil amended with SS, Vermi, and HM as an alternative to the use of inorganic fertilizer (Inorg).

Spatial variability of soils is an important component to consider when managing land for agricultural uses. One soil forming factor that influences the dynamics of soil properties at the ecosystem level is topography. Both topography and microclimate influence soil properties even when land is managed identically. The objective of this study was to determine soil properties at different land management systems at three types of topography. Soil samples were collected Marion and Boyle Counties in central Kentucky. The studied sites were three pasture fields, three hay fields, and three cultivated areas. Each of the three sites for each land use type represented a separate topographic feature. Three wooded area sites, similarly separated by topography, were used as a reference. The surface (0-7.5 cm in depth) in both upper slope and toe slope positions, soil pH in hayfields was the highest followed by the cultivated fields, wooded areas, and pasture fields. Soil organic matter content was highest in wooded areas, followed by hayfields, pastures, and finally cultivated fields. Soil compaction decreased in the order of pasture areas, wooded areas, hayfields, and finally cultivated land, as shown by bulk density. This study provides insight into soil management across varying slopes and can support land use planning.

Soils have the largest carbon (C) pools in the biosphere with the greatest potential of C sequestration to mitigate global climate change impacts. Soil compaction and the content of soil carbon control crop productions. Soil compaction levels affect the growth of plant roots as well as the soil aeration. Carbon content provides the food and energy for soil microorganisms which can improve biological-chemical conditions of the growing media and plant health. The present study focused at comparing C sequestration potential and compaction levels of various agricultural lands including woodlands, croplands, grasslands, CRP lands, and crop rotation systems in Kentucky and Illinois. Soil properties tested were soil organic C, soil compaction as measured by penetrometer and bulk density, soil color, soil water holding capacity, soil water content at field capacity, macro-porosity and aggregate stability. Soil samples were collected from various farming systems at the depths of 7.5 cm and 15 cm in Calloway County, Kentucky and Jefferson County in Illinois. Wood areas were used as references for comparing between undisturbed and disturbed ecosystems. The data was analyzed using ANOVA one-way analysis with LSD test at 5% of level of significance to observe the significant difference among the fields and depth. The findings of this research will contribute to the knowledge of Climate Change Science and Soil Health in temperate areas under silt- and clay loam soils. The detailed results will be presented during the conference.

Healthy and productive soils are essential components of sustainable agriculture, this is especially true in an urban agriculture setting. This research aimed to determine topsoil health of twelve land use systems at Murray State University's Pullen Farm in western Kentucky. Locations ranging from cropland to urban style gardens were evaluated to ensure an in-depth study. Areas include a no-till garden, community garden, research tomato plots, sod, rain garden, pollinator garden, wooded area, intermittent waterway, hemp field, corn field, soybean field, and corn maze. Physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil health were measured at a depth of 0 to 7.5 cm in September 2021. Measurements included soil color, bulk density, compaction, soil pH, moisture, soil organic matter, and earthworm population. The highest soil organic matter values were observed in the gardens and the lowest was found in corn maze and soybean fields. The findings indicate that while pH and moisture are ideal in all locations examined, high compaction levels were paired with decreased earthworm count in some locations. This research shows that building organic matter is crucial for improving soil health and building soil sustainability. However, soil compaction must be managed to allow beneficial soil organisms to thrive and break down organic matter. The findings provide a resource for educating policymakers, practitioners, and the general public about the role of soils in urban agriculture to restore fertility, productivity, and ecosystem services of urban land for improving the overall quality of life of a growing urban population.

Lotus varieties are selected for flower, seed or tuber production. Fresh lotus seeds are consumed widely in China and other Asian countries and there is a potential market for fresh lotus pods as the population of Asian immigrants increases in Kentucky. Some consumers are willing to pay $1 or $2 for a quality fresh lotus seed pod. The objective of this project was to test the feasibility of growing lotus for fresh lotus seeds. A variety well known for its seed production (Jianxuan 17) (12 tubers) was planted in a shallow pond (7.8 square meters in area). After each plant had grown at least one standing leaf, 10-10-10 for Vegetabes (Southern States Cooperative) were applied every 21 days. The number of standing leaves, flower buds, flowers and seed pods were counted weekly. At the peak of the growing season (end of August), there were 262 standing leaves, 21 flower buds, 6 blooming flowers and 40 seed pods. Majority of the flower buds developed into blooming flowers then formed seed pods. These results suggest that each square meter of pond surface can produce 7-8 flowers and seed pods during the growing season. It is possible to grow lotus to produce fresh seed pods.

A lotus tuber usually has 2 – 3 growing tips. Potentially each of the growing tip could become a new lotus tuber. In our previous study, we found that the number of leaves and the yield of lotus tubers were similar whether the lotus plants were started with a lotus with multiple growing tips or a growing tip cut from a lotus tuber. The objective of this experiment was to determine the performance of lotus plants started with the same number of growing tips either kept together as one tuber or cut off a tuber. Four containers were each planted with a branch lotus tuber with 3 growing tips, whereas the other 4 containers were planted with 3 growing tips cut from a single branch lotus. Plastic containers (18-gallon volume) used in the experiment were filled with garden soil to 40 cm deep and rain water collected from a barn roof was added into the containers to cover the soil to a depth 10 cm below the rim of the containers. Half of the containers contained 20 g of 10-10-10 fertilizer for vegetables from the Southern State Cooperative. After at least one standing leave had grown up in each container, 6 g of fertilizers were applied to each container each month. The number of floating leaves, standing leaves, and flowers were counted each week. At the end of the experiment, lotus tubers were harvested from each container. Number of leaves reached the peak in August and died out toward the end of September. Number of leaves were slightly higher for lotus plants started from 20g of 10-10-10 fertilizers mixed in clay at the beginning. The containers with growing tips separated from a single tuber tended to have more standing leaves and higher yield of lotus tuber at the end of the experiment. These results that growth tips cut off the original lotus tuber grew just as well or better than growth tips not cut off the original lotus tuber. Including some granular fertilizers at the planting time helped lotus plant grow during the growing season.

Five soil management practices were used at the Kentucky State University Harold R. Benson Research and Demonstration Farm in Franklin County, Kentucky, to study the impact of soil amendments on the yield and quality of bell peppers (Intruder variety). The soil management practices were: sewage sludge (SS), chicken manure (CM), chitin (CH), biochar (BC), and no-mulch (NM) native soil used for comparison purposes. At maturity, plants were harvested, weighed, and classified according to the USDA grades into US Fancy, US No. 1, US No. 2, and culls. Overall results revealed that yield obtained from BC treatment was greater (175.3g fruit) than that of NM treatment (158.1g fruit). Using the USDA grades, BC had 34.8% US Fancy grade and 7.2% cull rate, while NM had 21.0% US Fancy grade and 22.6% cull rate. We recommend growing bell peppers in soil amended with biochar for greater yield and fruit quality.

This project examines the utility of integrating geospatial technology into the long-term monitoring and characterization of vegetation distributions within pasture land used for successive livestock grazing rotations. Small unmanned aerial systems (sUAV) are equipped with visible red, green, and blue (RGB) and near-infrared (NIR) sensors that measure reflected sunlight to make digital images. The images were then used to generate geographic information systems (GIS) based products, including digital terrain models (DTM) that are compared to existing known models for assessing spatial accuracy. In addition, digital surface models (DSM) and segmented classification maps were generated, highlighting the distribution of labeled vegetation classes within each of the rotation plots, focusing on July 2019 to 2021. Descriptive summaries are generated for each of the rotation plots quantifying spatial errors, land area occupied by each class, and land area subjected to change between each year included in the analysis. Preliminary results indicate acceptable spatial accuracy of sUAV-derived DTM models for vertical (z) and, even more so, in the horizontal locations (x,y) relative to lidar-derived model; however, work continues to assess the extent of spatial uncertainty and for adjusting for the observed errors. In addition, the imagery-based classifications of vegetation classes have proven effective for characterizing both the static distribution of vegetation and clear indication of physical change to some parts of the rotation plots, resulting, presumably, from behavior and movements of the livestock herds over time. This work will inform practices in animal science at Kentucky State University.

The agricultural production of tomatoes Solanum lycopersicum L. (Solanaceae) occurs globally within an array of different climates and systems including open fields, high tunnels, greenhouses, and plant factories with artificial lighting (PFAL). With the effects of global warming becoming more apparent in everyday life, the impact of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on the atmosphere is becoming a larger concern. Many companies have begun performing life cycle assessments (LCA) to measure the impact of global warming potential (GWP) of a specific product. This study includes collecting select input data for the Berea College Farm, including tomato yields for the years 2019-2020 and running it through an accessible LCA software, EUPHOROS, to calculate the GWP of organic high tunnel tomato production in Berea, Kentucky, USA. These numbers were then compared to different production systems around the world, and the results indicate that the GWP for producing tomatoes at the Berea College Farm is higher than more intensive forms of agriculture. A detailed analysis of the data suggests that natural gas is one of the largest contributors to the Berea College system.

Eggplant is a member of the genus Solanum and is related to the tomato, chili pepper, and potato. Eggplant is a high-fiber, low-calorie food that is rich in nutrients and comes with many potential health benefits, from reducing the risk of heart disease to helping with blood sugar control and weight loss. An experiment was conducted to determine the impact of soil amendments: sewage sludge (SS), chicken manure (CM), biochar (BIO), chitin (CH), sewage sludge mixed with biochar (SS+BIO), sewage sludge mixed with chitin (SS+CH), chicken manure mixed with biochar (CM+BIO), chicken manure mixed with chitin (CM+CH), and no-mulch soil (NM) on the yield and quality of harvested eggplant. Eggplants were grown in 27 plots, representing 3 replications of 9 different soil treatments. Mature plants were harvested and weighed, and the number and quality of the fruits were recorded. Chitin alone and CM+BIO treatments produced the highest number of fruits and total weight (12.8 and 11.3 kg, respectively), while the combination of CM+CH and SS alone produced the least number of fruits and lowest total weight (3.7 and 3.4 kg, respectively). U.S. #1 grade composed the greatest total number of fruits compared to U.S. Fancy and U.S. #2. U.S. Fancy did have the greatest total harvested fruit weight compared to U.S. #1 and U.S. #2, with a 68.0% and 796.8% increase, respectively. We concluded that growing plants in chitin alone and in CM+BIO treatments enhanced both yield and quality of the fruits.

Exposure to inorganic arsenic as a biproduct of industry has a carcinogenic effect in humans. Therefore, a multitude of cancers are associated with increased arsenic exposure, including lung cancer. There is an observed cellular transition in human lung epithelial cells caused by this exposure: an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. As a partial mechanism to this epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, the histone octamer variant expression is altered with varying arsenic exposure. Variants of the histones change the stereochemistry of one of the eight parts of the histone octamer protein complex. Even these small changes to a histone alter the compaction of the chromosomes; thus, leaving DNA more exposed to transcription factors in cancerous cells. Using Western Blot analysis, the protein levels of different histone variants H2A, H2B, H3, H4, H2AFV, and H2AZ were observed in human lung epithelial cells and Drosophila cells with varying arsenic exposure conditions. Both species did have all the testing variants of the histone octamer present. Conversely, in humans, there were observed trends in histone concentrations for most of the histones, but the Drosophila tests were unquantifiable. In conclusion, epigenetic factors such as histone octamers do have an important role in contributing to cancer as expression rates change with exposure to carcinogens, such as arsenic. With the continual observation of histone trends, histone therapy may emerge as a possible cancer treatment.

Arsenic exposure is a significant worldwide environmental health concern. This is especially true in areas like Eastern Kentucky, where coal mining is prevalent. In fact, chronic arsenic exposure has been associated with a higher than normal risk of skin, lung, and bladder cancer, as well as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. While arsenic-induced biological changes play a role in disease pathology, little is known about the resulting dynamic cellular changes affecting nucleosomal architectural proteins, namely histones. Here, we sought to uncover the molecular mechanisms behind histone variants incorporation into the nucleosome leading to differential stability and dynamics. To that end, we employed various biochemical and biophysical assays. We successfully overexpressed variants H2BJ and H2BK and found that these variants induce morphological changes in BEAS-2B cells, recapitulating their overexpression in arsenic-induced cells. These variant overexpressing cells also showed expression changes in key EMT markers. Additionally, these variants were less resistant to micrococcal nuclease digestion (MNase) suggesting that, when incorporated into the nucleosome, they render it less stable. Together, these results suggest that arsenic exposure affects nucleosome stability leading to gene expression changes and carcinogenesis.

Planarians are flatworms with an abundance of adult stem cells which allow for regenerative properties. These characteristics make flatworms such as Schmidtea mediterranea model systems to study tumor suppressing function. Planarians typically do not get tumors, likely linked to tumor suppressor genes involved in DNA repair or prevention of excess stem cell proliferation. The purpose of the project was to research a list of SET1 target genes which were identified from wide peaks of histone H3 K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3). Five set1 genes (set1-dR-3, -3-2 (ARF), -54 (LASP1), -61 (CSK), -65 (TRAF1)), were cloned and examined using RNAi. Knockdown of two set1 target genes (-54, -61) produced a novel phenotype in cut and uncut S. mediterranea. Set1-dR_54 and set1-dR_61 are both related to muscle cells, prompting the need for further research into these target genes and their effect on maintenance of the flatworm.

Sarcopenia, the loss of mass and function in skeletal muscle, can cause reduction in the quality of life, and may lead to further injury. Recovery is thought to be more attainable in young adults when compared to aged adults. I hypothesized that the total area of collagen will remain high throughout the period of recovery post- hindlimb suspension, investigating the relationship of collagen and recovery. The ages of rats were determined to be 10 months (Adult) and 32 months (Aged). To induce muscle atrophy, rats were suspended by their hind limbs for 14 days, and were reloaded (free movement) for either 0, 7, 15, or 60 days. Cyclic Compressive Loading (CCL) is a method which improves muscle regrowth in both adult and aged rats after suspension. In this loading method, rats are able to return to a free mobility environment. Sections of the gastrocnemius muscle were cut and plated on microscope slides. These were then stained using a Picrosirius red staining solution, which stains collagen types i, and iii- the major mechanical component of the extracellular matrix in skeletal muscle. Cross sections of the Gastrocnemius skeletal muscle were analyzed, and fiber cross sectional area (CSA), along with the collagen area were investigated. Collagen area was determined and compared, in ratio, with the remainder of skeletal muscle tissue (total µm- collagen). The collagen area was also compared, in ratio, with the total µm in the sample (constant throughout all samples). These quantifications along with data analysis revealed that collagen levels remain high throughout recovery, relative to the control- but have clear fluctuations dependent on the reloading time. It is also clear that the variable of age in collagen levels is a determining factor in recovery.

Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is a carcinogenic pollutant found in cigarette smoke, grilled food, and vehicle exhaust. It belongs to a group of pollutants known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In human and animal studies, BaP exposure is associated with impaired learning, memory, and motor skills. Interestingly, BaP is also associated with changes in serotonin and anxiety. We used a mouse model to determine if genetic differences in the enzymes required to metabolize BaP would affect the response to developmental BaP exposure. Mice were exposed to BaP starting from gestational day 10 until postnatal day 25- equivalent to the second and third trimesters in humans when brain development is at its peak. We used a forced swim test to analyze their depressive-like behavior and measured their stress hormone levels at baseline and immediately after the swim test to determine if genetic makeup affected their response to a stressful stimulus. BaP exposure showed no effect, but genotype had a significant difference, with the AhrdCyp1a2(-/-) mice having a longer float time compared to the AhrbCyp1a2(+/+) and AhrbCyp1a1(-/-) mice. Analyzing the stress hormone levels indicated that the AhrbCyp1a2(+/+) had higher cortisol levels but this was not statistically significant. The data appears to indicate that the low affinity mice were not able to properly metabolize the BaP; consequently, causing them to show more depressive signs and lower stress levels.

Obesity is a serious health condition that can cause various diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. While environmental factors such as an unhealthy dietary regimen and insufficient exercise are known to play roles in obesity, high sugar diets have also been shown to take part in this health condition. Due to the polygenic aspect of obesity, one of the keys to understanding genetic susceptibility to obesity is the identification of DNA variations associated with this condition. Using Drosophila as the model organism for this research, the phenotypic variations of body weight and food consumption were investigated under a low (5%) and high (20%) sugar diet. In conducting this genome wide association study (GWAS), 180 different lines from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) were utilized. Upon completion of the GWAS, candidate genes that demonstrate an association with obesity will be tested via a genetic mutagenesis approach. The results of this study will not only allow a better understanding of sugar mediated obesity, but have the potential to reveal certain genetic factors that may be connected to obesity in humans.

Sugar is a key part of the daily diet, and it is often a contributing factor to many metabolic disorders such as diabetes, cancer etc. Understanding the genetic mechanism for sugar consumption-based feeding is critical to combating the metabolic disorders because not so much is known in terms of genetic factors controlling sugar-based feeding. The goal of this study is to find gene(s) and pathways linked to sugar consumption by employing Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) in 180 Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) strains as a model organism. For 7 days, each of the DGRP lines was fed 5% (low) and 20% (high) sugar diet with an equivalent amount of other ingredients. Using the modified Con-Ex test to measure food consumption, most of the lines tested so far displayed compensatory feeding with different degree of variation among the lines in response to the two sugar diets ingested over the 7-day period. Using the phenotypic data for GWAS, we were able to map quantitative trait loci for sugar dependent feeding behavior and found some candidate genes linked to high sugar-based compensatory feeding. These discoveries provide information on the genetics involved in sugar-based feeding in the body, as well as how it can be controlled to accommodate various health situations.

Sperm cells are some of the most highly specialized cells in animals. Their unique function, to carry male genetic information, and morphology are highly conserved across the animal world. Spermatogenesis, the production of sperm, is strikingly similar in Drosophila melanogaster and mammals, making Drosophila an excellent model. Individualization of the spermatids is required to finalize the development of the 64 spermatozoa. The cell communication pathway JAK-STAT (Janus Kinase, Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription) is required to induce individualization. Prior to individualization, JAK-STAT signaling is activated in the somatic cyst cells by the spermatids. The two somatic cyst cells surrounding the spermatids send a signal to the spermatids to begin individualization. To study which genes might have a role in individualization, a candidate gene list was created from genes that were differentially expressed after JAK-STAT signaling was impaired in somatic cells. Candidate genes were knocked down or overexpressed specifically in the germline (VasaGAL) or the somatic cells (EyaGAL)using the GAL4-UAS system. Many genes showing statistically significant differences compared to the control were metalloproteases, where overexpression of a metalloprotease inhibitor in somatic cyst cells might be having an effect on individualization. Genes expressed early in individualization responsible for cell polarity produced underdeveloped testes when knocked down.

Breast cancer affects 1 in 8 women during their lifetime in the United States, of which triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is noted to be the most lethal and aggressive form. Furthermore, TNBC currently has a higher rate of metastasis and recurrence than any other form of breast cancer. TNBC is unresponsive to hormone therapy due to a lack of the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu) expression. Platinum based chemotherapies have been a staple in breast cancer therapy, of which cisplatin and carboplatin are commonly prescribed. However, the high levels of toxicity attributed to cisplatin and the lack of targeting of carboplatin render these drugs unsuitable for TNBC therapy. In our current study, we show the targeting nature of our synthesized Pt-Mal-LHRH compound towards TNBC. Our lab was able to show a significant increase in tumor uptake of our Pt-Mal-LHRH compound compared to carboplatin. Moreover, Pt-Mal-LHRH showed a significant decrease in targeting towards skeletal muscle in comparison to carboplatin. Furthermore, we compared in-vivo tumor growth rates during Pt-Mal-LHRH, cisplatin, and carboplatin injection (15 mg/kg/wk) over a 2-week period. We found a significant attenuation in tumor growth in mice administered Pt-Mal-LHRH. Although further research within clinical trials is needed to ensure its safety within human beings, Pt-Mal-LHRH shows promise as an upcoming treatment option for TNBC patients.

Flash radiotherapy is the administration of an ultra-high dose of radiation over a short time (e.g., >60Gy/sec). Flash radiotherapy induces a phenomenon known as the Flash effect, whereby the ultra-high dose rate radiation reduces the normal tissue toxicities commonly associated with conventional radiotherapy while maintaining local tumor control. The total radiation dose administered is the same for both conventional and Flash radiotherapy. In recent years, the Flash effect has been confirmed in many studies, both in-vitro and in-vivo. While the exact underlying mechanism(s) responsible for the Flash effect remain a mystery, the oxygen depletion hypothesis is one of the most prominent hypotheses. The oxygen depletion hypothesis is based on the oxygen effect, which refers to the increased radiosensitivity of tissue in the presence of oxygen compared to that in anoxic or hypoxic conditions, where the oxygen tension is less than one percent at atmospheric pressure. Studies have shown that the relative damage by radiation can be enhanced up to three times by oxygen. This study aimed to assess the role of oxygen concentration for the Flash effect and compare the impact of Flash and Conventional irradiation in vitro by using clonogenic assay and evaluating cell damage by double-strand DNA breaks. Results from the clonogenic assay show the inverse correlation between the surviving fraction and the oxygen concentration, especially at 3%, confirming the oxygen effect. The overall DNA damage assessed by the western blot shows higher under the Standard irradiation than Flash irradiation and lower in hypoxic than normoxic conditions. In the future, we hope to replicate the experiment with different cell lines and test different oxygen concentrations and additional time points post-irradiation.

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is one of the most common cancers in the United States. These tumors often exhibit biallelic loss of function of SETD2, which classically regulates gene transcription by regulating specific histone methylations. Preliminary data suggest that SETD2 specifically regulates methylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 1a (eEF1A1) by regulating the expression of the methyltransferases EEF1AKMT2 and EEF1AKMT3. However, the mechanism whereby these transcriptional changes promote the cancer phenotype remain undefined. Here, using a genetic approach, we demonstrate that deletion of SETD2 in HKC cells increases soft agar colony formation (a proxy for tumor growth) and decreases protein translation relative to cells with intact SETD2 expression. Overexpression of EEF1AKMT2 in SETD2-KO cells reverses these phenotypes. These findings support the hypothesis that loss of function of SETD2 is a trigger for cell proliferation and tumor growth while dysregulating protein synthesis. By better understanding the correlation between the loss of SETD2, eEF1A methylation, and EEF1AKMT2 expression, we seek to reveal new paradigms whereby SETD2 promotes tumor formation. This knowledge could potentially be exploited for precision medicine approaches targeted towards SETD2-mutated tumors.

Telomeres are repetitive sections of DNA at the termini of eukaryotic chromosomes that protect the ends from harm and limit how many times the cell can divide. Two of our greatest medical challenges, cancer and aging, are closely related to telomeres; most cancers upregulate telomerase, and aging human cells display shorter telomeres. To investigate the evolution and function of telomeres, I am circularizing chromosome VII in a strain of the single-celled eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This circularization will remove the telomeres from the chromosome and fuse its ends together, allowing us to study how fit yeast are without linear chromosomes and telomeres. To circularize the chromosomes, we are creating two DNA cassettes—one for the left arm and one for the right arm. Both cassettes contain a region of homology with the chromosome, a selectable marker gene, and opposite halves of the URA3 gene. The cassettes are then integrated into the chromosome distal to any functional genes. The two halves of the URA3 gene contain a region of homology, allowing recombination between the cassettes that will result in a circularized chromosome. I have thus far created the right and left arm cassettes for chromosome VII, obtained several candidate colonies for left cassette integration, and am currently testing for integration by PCR across the junction. The long-term goal of this project is to create a strain of S. cerevisiae with all its chromosomes circularized, allowing us to study the fitness and viability of a eukaryote without telomeres.

Linear eukaryotic chromosomes have specialized regions at the ends called telomeres. During DNA replication, telomeres are not fully copied which leads to a shortening of chromosomes and contributes to the process of aging. To counteract this issue, most eukaryotic organisms express the enzyme telomerase. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme complex that extends telomeres during DNA replication. Telomerase, however, can cause harm to an organism as increased levels of telomerase enzyme are observed in >85% of human cancers. While telomerase is crucial to the maintenance of chromosomes, the structure and function of telomerase RNA are not completely understood. To better understand telomerase RNA, we developed a genetic approach to identify novel gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in telomerase RNA. In our first step, we created a library of ∼5,000 random telomerase RNA variants using error-prone PCR. After transforming these mutants into yeast as the sole copy of telomerase RNA, we took advantage of the telomere position effect (TPE) to select mutants better lengthen telomeres. With TPE, silencing of a URA3 marker gene inserted near a telomere is greater on longer telomeres, which we can select for by better growth on media containing the counter-selectable drug 5-floroorotic acid (5-FOA). From our experiments so far, we have identified and sequenced ∼100 putative GOF mutants, 15 of which have been validated as true GOF alleles. Currently, we are continuing to validate GOF candidates and determine the mechanism(s) by which the mutations increase the function of telomerase RNA.

Biological macromolecules such as proteins serve a very crucial function in all biological processes. Protein structure plays a key role in determining its function; therefore, one of the key areas of structural biology is inferring how proteins work by analyzing their three-dimensional structure. The availability of atomic resolution structure provides for a broader and more revolutionary understanding of protein function, as well as contributes to the unraveling of the inner workings of living cells. The need for an understanding of protein structures assists in determining their functionality and interactions with other macromolecules. The three-dimensional structure of proteins can be determined using X-ray crystallography and computational analysis. This project will allow to go through the training to determine the 3-D model structure of proteins from the information gathered from X-ray crystallography using CCP4i graphical interface suite. The structural analyses can further provide insights to target disease and play an important role in drug design and therapeutics.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, methyl groups are added to the 2‘-O position of nucleotides C32 and G34 of tRNAPhe to facilitate translation. The methyltransferase Trm7 interacts separately with accessory proteins Trm732 and Trm734 to accomplish both modifications, and at least one modification is required for healthy growth under non-stressed conditions. Although the function of the Gm34 modification is known, the functional purpose of the Cm32 modification is not. Hydrogen peroxide and the arginine analogue canavanine were employed as stressors to better define the sensitivities of yeast strains lacking Cm32, Gm34, or both modifications. Strains lacking TRM7 (trm7Δ mutants), TRM732 or TRM734 appear to show lowered resistance to oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide. Growth tests indicate that the trm734Δsrc1Δ mutant grows poorly in hydrogen peroxide compared to the trm734Δ or src1Δ mutants. Inconsistent with previous research, the trm734Δ mutant does not display an increased canavanine resistance compared to a wild-type strain.

Amyloid-beta (Aβ) and insulin, two substrates of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), are critically important in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), respectively. IDE is a major Aβ-degrading enzyme, linked with slowed AD progression. Conversely, inhibiting IDE results in retention of insulin, thus reducing T2D symptoms. IDE was identified as a cytosolic enzyme despite substrate degradation occurring in the endosome, raising the question of how the enzyme gains substrate access. Recent studies established the role of phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PtdInsPs) which localize IDE to endosomes through the polyanion-binding site. However, the polyanion-binding site partially overlaps the substrate-binding site, raising concerns that disabling IDE's localization mechanism could disrupt substrate degradation. The purpose of this project is to produce a mutant version of IDE that does not bind to PtdInsPs to localize to endosomal compartments while retaining full enzyme activity. IDE localization could be disrupted to reduce insulin catabolism without affecting cytosolic IDE, thus slowing the progression of T2D. This innovative project utilized molecular visualization systems and online servers to characterize interactions between IDE and substrate peptides using structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Structural analysis revealed that a majority of residues mediating substrate binding are not found in the polyanion binding site. Future studies are aimed at better understanding interactions between PtdInsPs headgroups and IDE to define residues to mutate. These studies provide the molecular basis for substrate recognition and offer insight into designing novel IDE-based therapies to control amyloid-beta and blood sugar concentrations.

The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) is a transmembrane protein that regulates neurodegeneration associated with a variety of pathological conditions. The binding of neurotrophins to p75NTR stimulates its cleavage by Tumor Necrosis Factor-α Converting Enzyme (TACE) and γsecretase to generate receptor fragments that facilitate downstream signaling. We recently discovered that oxidative stress similarly induces p75NTR cleavage in dopaminergic neurons, a cell type vulnerable to neurodegeneration associated witParkinson's disease (PD). Notably, p75NTR signaling in this context did not require neurotrophins. While these findings revealed a novel mechanism of p75NTR induction, further studies are needed to understand the molecular interactions that regulate ligand-independent p75NTR signaling and the physiological roles of these events in dopaminergic neurons. Here, we demonstrate that cleavage of p75NTR is induced in dopaminergic neurons exposed to rotenone, a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor commonly used to model PD. To identify p75NTR interactors that may regulate this stress-induced signaling cascade, we characterized the expression of multiple p75NTR co-receptors in dopaminergic neurons treated with rotenone. Our preliminary analyses revealed that healthy and damaged dopaminergic neurons lack expression of TrkB, but abundantly produce sortilin. Based on these data, we are currently evaluating the effects of sortilin on p75NTR proteolysis induced by oxidative stress. Furthermore, we are currently assessing the effects of p75NTR on neurite degeneration and death of dopaminergic neurons using a combination of cell culture and animal models. Altogether, these studies will provide important insight into factors that regulate p75NTR signaling and the contributions of such events to neurodegeneration associated with PD.

Nonunion fractures are a significant human and financial burden. Autografting, the gold standard therapy, is invasive and costly. Tissue engineering offers affordable and effective potential therapy. An applicable hydrogel would need to modulate osteogenic and immune cells. Macrophage immunophenotype is dependent upon healing stage and influences the strength and speed of fracture healing. Research into biochemical influences on macrophage phenotype are abundant, but biomechanical influences have been less thoroughly explored. Substrate elasticity modulates macrophage immunophenotype. However, human tissues are viscoelastic, exhibiting varying rates of stress relaxation. We hypothesized 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) conjugation of Alginate and Gelatin into an Alg-Gel polymer would offer the calcium-modulated viscoelastic properties of ionically crosslinked alginate with the cell attachment capabilities of Gelatin in a non-cytotoxic and versatile hydrogel. Mechanical testing of Alg-Gel hydrogel revealed initial moduli and stress relaxation times which could be modulated with Calcium concentration similar to that of Alginate hydrogels and demonstrated cell viability indicative of cell adhesion, indicating that this hydrogel may be a viable subject for future research into biomechanical macrophage immunophenotype modulation and tissue engineering treatment research for nonunion fractures.

PAS domain containing protein kinase (Pask) is essential in the detection of and respective response regarding environmental signals from within the stem cell niche. The ability to phosphorylate Wdr5, a strictly nuclear protein and eventual epigenetic activator of transcription, is key to the function of Pask. However, in normal cell conditions, Pask remains in the cytosol of the cell, waiting to perform its function. Here, we examine some of the possible mechanisms by which Pask is able to migrate to the nucleus. Without the migration back into the cytosol, stem cells keep differentiating and this has detrimental effects on homeostasis of the cell, therefore making this mechanism incredibly critical to the function of PasK and by extension, the differentiation of stem cells.

Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, yet no effective treatment exists. Adult cardiomyocytes exit the cell cycle at maturation, so they cannot regenerate themselves after enduring damage. This research hopes to determine the histological and functional improvements of TNNT2-4F-NIL, a gene therapy treatment that induces the overexpression of four cell cycle regulators – cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1, CDK4, cyclin B1, and cyclin D1 – transiently and specifically in cardiomyocytes. Heart damage was induced in rat hearts; one week later, the rats received the viral treatment or control-NIL. During these four months, echocardiograms (ECHO) were used to determine cardiac function in four-week intervals. Four weeks post-injection, the ejection fraction of TNNT2-4F-NIL rats was significantly improved compared to Control-NIL rats (p<0.01). TNNT2-4F-NIL rats maintained improved cardiac function for four months post-injection. Four months after the viral injection, there was a significant decrease in scar size in the TNNT2-4F-NIL group compared to Control-NIL rats (p<0.01). TNNT2-4F-NIL does not significantly affect cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area four months post viral injection (p>0.05). Overall, this data suggests that TNNT2-4F-NIL effectively improves heart histology and function four months following injection.

For a virus to infect a host cell it must bind to the cell's surface, fuse with the plasma membrane, and enter the cell. Unlike most viruses that encode a small number of proteins for binding and fusion, vaccinia virus, a member of the poxvirus family, encodes 11 proteins (A16, A21, F9, G3, G9, H2, J5, A28, L1, O3 and L5). These viral proteins form an entry fusion complex on the surface of vaccinia virus [1,2]. The yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system was used to screen direct interactions between those viral proteins. The coding region of each vaccinia protein was fused with either the activation or binding domain of a common transcription factor and transformed into yeast. Interactions between these proteins brought the two domains together. These interactions were detected by the activation of genes that coded for proteins that are required for growth on selective media and produced an enzyme that cleaves X gal, turning the colonies blue. In an initial screen, putative interactions between J3ACT and J3Bind, F9ACT and J3Bind were observed. These need to be confirmed by remaking and rescreening the yeast hybrids as well as confirming that the recombinant vaccina virus protein alone cannot active expression of the reporter gene.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition in which loss of neurons, their axons and axon myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs) is a major driver of a long-lasting functional deficits including disrupted sensation and locomotion. OL protection and remyelination by oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) is critical for functional recovery after contusive SCI. However, SCI-induced, OL-specific changes in gene expression have not yet been reported at the transcriptomic/translatomic level. Using 10-week-old Plp1-CreERT2:Rpl22HA female mice (n=3 /group) to induce the Ribo-Tag in mature OLs, we isolated OL-specific mRNAs from the injury epicenter following moderate T10 contusion. We initially confirmed reliable isolation of OL-specific mRNAs as evidenced by enrichment of myelin-associated genes only found in OLs when comparing the OL translatome to total RNA samples. Using uninjured cord from naïve mice as a control, extensive changes in OL translatome mRNAs were documented at acute (2 days post injury, dpi), subacute (10 dpi), and chronic (42 dpi) timepoints. These genes included upregulation of the OL injury response markers Klk8 and C4b. Among 77 mRNAs that were highly upregulated selectively in OLs at all timepoints post-SCI, enriched gene ontology (GO) terms included organismal development, cell differentiation, nervous system development, and cell-cell signaling. OLs upregulated secreted inhibitors of BMP (Sostdc1), WNT (Sostdc1, Sfrp5), and Notch (Egfl8, Dlk2) signaling, pathways which are implicated in inhibiting OPC to OL differentiation. Furthermore, secretory neurotrophic factors (Gdnf and Nrtn) were also upregulated in OLs during the acute and subacute stages of SCI.

Traditionally, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has been used to determine structure in both organic and inorganic compounds in both solution and solid-state. Mostly the focus has remained on NMR active nuclei that are highly abundant (1H, 19F, 23Na, 87Rb, or 27Al) or that can be introduced synthetically into (mostly peptide and protein) compounds (13C or 15N). A distinct challenge exists when we attempt to collect NMR data from samples that are low abundance and low sensitivity (such as 29Si, 33S, 17O, or 67Zn). Our group has continued research that was started at The Ohio State University by Professor Baltisberger working with Professor Grandinetti where they used shaped refocusing pulses along with CPMG acquisition to acquire signal enhancement comparable to other much more expensive techniques (such as DNP). We developed the pulse sequences needed (see poster by Kambarami for more details) to achieve these sensitivity gains and attempted to implement them on a variety of samples. Our goal is to be able to have 17O natural abundance MQMAS data like the 27Al MQMAS data we acquired on Kyanite. Due to hardware problems, we have not yet fully achieved this goal and continue to work towards fixing the problems.

Our research this summer was focused on implementing solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments on the new JEOL ECZR 500 that was purchased in Spring 2019 at Berea College. These experimental sequences are intended to support undergraduate teaching and research laboratory experiences. This work focused on quadrupolar (nuclear spin, I > ½) isotopes of interest. We initially spent time learning how to manage a solid-state NMR probe (tuning, shimming, setting magic-angle, setting pulse-widths, etc.) Using this probe, we then wrote and updated sequences to acquire 2H spectra (one and two dimensions), perform Rotor Assisted Polarization Transfer (RAPT) on half-integer quadrupolar nuclei (87Rb, 27Al, etc.), conduct echo train acquisition experiments (CPMG and PIETA), and finally collect Multiple Quantum Magic Angle Spinning (MQMAS) data. These sequences are now fully generalized and are being used to conduct additional sensitivity enhancement experiments at Berea.

Chromatographic studies on some Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators [SERMs] used for Doping in Sports The World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) mission is “to lead a collaborative worldwide movement for doping-free sport” (WADA). For this mission, the WADA needs quick and accurate methods for analyzing athletes' biological fluids for possible performance enhancing drugs (PEDs). Doping began as early as the third century, through various remedies to enhance athletic performance; despite its early appearance, the ban of doping for athletes internationally did not start until 1928. Testing and disqualifications for the use of PEDs were not possible until the Olympics in 1968. This research will focus on the analysis of a type of hormone and metabolic modulator known as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs); these PEDs have been preferred over anabolic steroids because they exclude obvious symptoms of abuse like gynecomastia (growth of breast tissue in males). They do have a number of medical uses, such as the treatment of breast cancer and osteoporosis; however, the WADA bans them because SERMs increase the testosterone levels in the body. There is currently little research of using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GCMS) for the analysis of SERMs. This research is primarily focused on developing and validating simple, sensitive, rapid and economic GC-MS analytical methods for determination of SERMs and other PEDs in bulk and in biological fluids.

Water and soil samples from multiple field sites of geological significance were collected by the presenter and her undergraduate students, including hot springs and mud pots at Yellowstone National Park, the alkaline Mono Lake in California, and hot springs altered due to the 2018 Kilauea volcanic eruption in Hawaii. These locations represent “extreme” locations in which life has evolved, and as such these terrestrial analogue sites represent unique environments to study both astrobiology and origin-of-life chemical questions. In this work, the pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, sulfide, and chloride levels of the water were tested on-site with a Hach portable colorimeter. Water and soil samples were also collected and transported back to the laboratory for further analysis, including microbial diversity profiling via 16s rRNA next generation sequencing. Future plans with these samples include analyzing the relative stability of natural and unnatural biological building blocks (such as amino acids and nucleotides), when exposed to the extreme conditions found in both the water and soil surrounding these geologically unique locations. In addition to the scientific findings, this field work collection allowed for significant student engagement and ownership as a member of the scientific community.

Steroid hormones play a crucial role in physiological processes like growth, development, and reproduction, and are synthesized naturally by most animal species. Estrogens, a class of steroidal hormones, are produced by females, especially in high amounts during pregnancy. It is estimated that around 49 tons of estrogens are generated annually by livestock waste in the US alone,1,2 which mostly comes from pregnant cattle. These estrogens, excreted in urine and feces, find their way into the environment when livestock waste is applied to the agricultural lands as manure. It has been reported that these estrogens contaminating the environment cause hormonal imbalance in many fish species, hence classified as endocrine disrupting chemicals. Studies conducted on male fish which are exposed to very low concentrations of endogenous estrogens estrone, and 17β-estradiol showed female characteristics and intersexuality.3,4 Hence it is important to assess the potential risk of estrogen contamination originating from agricultural wastes. Our study is focused on the qualitative and quantitative determination of estrogens in anaerobically digested cattle waste using analytical instruments LC-MS/MS and GC/MS. This presentation focuses on the method development and extraction of estrogens from dairy cattle waste using solid phase extraction (SPE) and stir bar sorptive extraction techniques (SBSE). The outcome of our study will help in regulating waste management practices.

Monitoring chemical reactions in aqueous solution is a challenge because most instrumental techniques either are not suited for the rapid timescales, are not sensitive enough to detect products at low concentrations, or do not have sufficient structure-to-spectrum relationships. Raman spectroscopy is a promising method to monitor reactions, as it is fast and dependent on structure but without a strong signal from water; however, Raman scattering is generally very weak. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) improves the signal strength of Raman spectroscopy by using a metal surface plasmon, or oscillation of the surface's electrons, to allow for highly-selective and sensitive detection and characterization of molecules in solution. An aqueous colloid of partially aggregated gold nanoparticles is an accessible substrate to generate plasmons necessary for SERS. Analyte is adsorbed to the nanoparticles, and structural changes can be detected as peaks in the Raman spectra change over time. Paraquat, a common yet dangerous herbicide that is banned in the EU and China, was monitored with SERS in real time as it degrades when exposed to intense light, analogous to sunlight. The photodegradation products have not been well characterized in the past, but methylpyridinium is expected. A reaction mechanism and kinetics can then be determined for this reaction. Gathering better data about paraquat and its degradation in the environment may help guide users to apply paraquat in a manner that minimizes harm to humans and the ecosystem.

Cancer resistance decreases the effectiveness of currently available cancer therapies. One type of cancer resistance is the Base Excision Repair Pathway (BER). Alkoxyamines, such as TRC102 (methoxyamine), is currently being investigated in combinatorial cancer therapies to inhibit the BER pathway; thus, potentiating current cancer therapies. In particular, TRC102 binds apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites in DNA to indirectly inhibit the mammalian AP enzyme 1 (APE 1). APE1 is a validated drug target to effectively inhibit the BER pathway. There exists very few alkoxyamine compounds in the literature that bind the AP site within DNA. This research objective is to design and implement a viable synthetic route to prepare novel alkoxyamine derivatives that can inhibit APE1 by covalently binding AP sites within DNA. A total of three synthetic routes were evaluated. One synthetic route proved more successful than the other routes, utilizing a tertbutyloxycarbonyl protected hydroxyamine as the starting material. This synthetic route provided the characterized final product, alkoxy amine O-(2-benzyl)hydroxylamine hydrochloride in 29.7% yield. Although this is a low yield, this is a viable synthetic route that will be optimized in future studies. In addition, this synthetic route will offer a method to synthesize and evaluate other alkoxyamine derivatives to establish a structure activity relationship.

First-row metalloporphyrin complexes of Mn, Fe, Ru, Co have been extensively investigated, they have also been reported to exhibit effective catalytic activities and exciting mechanistic pathways in the oxidation of different organic substrates. Among the first-row transition metal metalloporphyrin complex, Cr-metalloporphyrin complex has received less attention and is scarcely investigated despite its interesting electronic properties that could confer great reactivity prowess. This research hinge on investigating oxo-intermediates of Chromium (III) 5,10,15,20-(1,2,3-trimethylphenyl) porphyrin chloride (CrIIITMPCl). Using both chemical and photochemical methods, CrIV and [CrV(TMP)O] intermediates were successfully generated. Chemical generation of oxo-chromium (V) tetramesityl porphyrin [CrV(TMP)O] complex was achieved using 5 equivalents of meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid. ESI-MS study of the oxo-intermediate confirmed the formation of [CrTMP)O] intermediate with a peak at 848 m/z. Further investigation using a one-electron reductant also confirmed the formation of Oxo-Chromium (V) intermediate. Kinetic studies were performed on the reactive intermediates using substituted Thioanisole and alkene substrates. [CrIV(TMP)O] showed a positive reactivity towards most substrates except 4-Chlorothioanisole and the alkenes while [CrV(TMP)O] showed significant reactivity in all the substrates. These results suggest that [CrV(TMP)O] is an O-intermediate with a higher oxidation state than [CrIV(TMP)O]. Also, from the kinetic studies, it can be deduced that the Cr-metalloporphyrin complex would be an efficient metalloporphyrin complex useful in oxidation reactions.

Due to the ongoing, widespread antibacterial resistance, there is a growing need for novel antibacterial compounds with new cellular mechanisms of action. To this effect, N-succinyl-L,Ldiaminopimelic acid desuccinylase (DapE), a crucial enzyme in the production of lysine and meso-diaminopimelate (m-Dap), has emerged as a promising inhibitor for the development of the bacterial cell wall. DapE is a metallohydrolase that is essential for the growth and proliferation across many strands of bacteria. This key enzyme is present in most gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Therefore, the inhibition of DapE is lethal to bacteria by eradicating the downstream production of lysine and m-Dap. Considering that there is no similar DapE pathway in mammals, the target of the DapE will only be destructive to bacterial function. This work focuses on the synthesis of acyclic sulfonamide derivatives that could potentially serve as DapE inhibitors.

In nature, the cytochrome P450 enzyme superfamily is known for their ability to catalyze many oxidation reactions and have inspired the synthesis of synthetic metal complexes as biomimetic catalysts. These catalytic reactions involve the formation of a high valent transition metal-oxo intermediate as the active oxygen atom transfer species. The highly electron withdrawing chromium (III) tetrakis-2,3,4,5,6-pentaflourophenyl porphyrin was first synthesized and characterized. Then, the complex was used to generate the chromium (IV) oxo intermediate using the oxygen source iodobenzene diacetate. The kinetic studies performed involved the oxidation of triphenylphosphine, thioanisole, and thioanisole derivatives. The oxidation was observed with UV-Vis by watching the decay of the chromium (IV) peak. Then, the rate constants were determined and a Hammett Correlation Plot was made. Furthermore, catalytic studies were performed to determine the solvent and light effect on the porphyrin's oxidation capability of thioanisole.

The purpose of this work is to transform the precursor amino acid, L-DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine), first into the unreported amino acid, 3,4 diethynylphenylalanine, and then into an [18]-annulene. Unnatural amino acids are routinely used in the discovery and development of small molecule drug candidates. Napthylalanine, which is pseudo-isosteric with 3,4 diethynylphenylalanine, was recently reported as an integral part of a STAT3-SH2 inhibitor being developed for cancer treatment. The methodology to create this new amino acid includes protection of L-DOPA, substitution to form the protected arenediyne through Sonogashira cross-coupling and deprotection. The annulene can be prepared in a single step from the unprotected amino acid via Hay coupling. This poster will review the current progress in the synthesis of the 3,4 diethynylphenylalanine and the corresponding [18]-annulene. Furthermore, this poster will highlight our initial efforts to prepare a [m]4-oxacalixarene based on L-DOPA.

1,8-Naphthalimide based chemosensors were synthesized and shown to bind copper ion over other metal ions (Li+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Zn2+, Hg2+, Co2+, Cr3+, Cd2+, and Al3+) in an acetonitrile and acetonitrile-aqueous mixture solvent system. 1,8-Naphthalimide is selected as fluorophore (fluorescent compound) because of its long emission wavelength band (400-600 nm), a large stokes shift, insensitive to pH and synthetic versatility. While triazole functional group, synthesized by copper catalyzed Huisgen Azide Alkyne cycloaddition reaction (known as click reaction) is used as binding sites for metal ion. Compounds show fluorescence with maximum around 530 nm which are quenched on addition of copper ion but other metal ions did not show a significant change in the fluorescence. Job's plot confirms a 1:1 binding stoichiometry while addition of sodium salt of EDTA shows its reversibility. Binding constant in UV-Vis and Fluorescence titrations and detection limit of copper ion will be calculated and its application in cell imaging will be studied in the future.

The goal of this research is to synthesize novel annulene-[m]4-oxacalixarene hybrid molecules. The root word calix is derived from the Greek word for chalice, signifying the cup-like shape calixarenes typically adopt in three-dimensional space. Because of the complexity of forming annulenes, we are first focusing our efforts toward the synthesis of closely related phenylethynyl-[m]4-oxacalixarenes. To form these hybrid molecules, a series of TBS protected 4,5-(phenylethynyl)catachols are being prepared with substituents that differ in their ability to donate or withdraw electron density. This poster will discuss the approach to the synthesis of these compounds using a palladium-catalyzed Sonogashira cross-coupling between 4-substitutedphenylacetylenes and TBS protected 4,5-diiodocatechol.

In Nature, the superfamily of cytochrome P450 enzymes catalyzes numerous oxidation reactions that has inspired the use of various synthetic metal complexes as biomimetic catalysts. In enzymatic and synthetic oxidation catalysis, a high-valent transition metal-oxo intermediate is typically formed as the active oxygen atom transfer (OAT) species. In this study, tetrakis-2,6-diflurorophenyl porphyrin(H2TDFPP) and its chromium (III) complex were synthesized and characterized by UV-vis, IR, and 1 H-NMR spectroscopies. The corresponding chromium(IV)oxo intermediate was generated by the chemical oxidation of the chromium(III) precursor with iodobenzene diacetate as the oxygen source. The kinetic studies of oxidation reactions of the generated chromium(IV)-oxo species with a variety of organic substrates including triphenylphosphine, thioanisole, and thioanisole derivatives were carried out, providing mechanistic insights into the identities of the active oxidants and oxidation reaction pathways of important catalysts.

Calixarenes are of interest because of the diverse applications, ranging from enzyme mimetics and ion sensitive electrodes to non-linear optics. Unfortunately, calixarenes tend to form in one-pot reactions and tend not to lend themselves to a more modular approach. The synthesis of oxacalixarens, where the calixarene methylene is replaced by an oxygen, can be controlled by the SNAr chemistry used to make them. This poster will describe the progress in the synthesis of an asymmetric [m]4-oxacalixaerene prepared from catechol, 4,5-bis(4'-acetamidophenylethynyl) catechol, and either 4,6-dinitro-1,3-difluorobenzene or 2,6-dichloropyrazine.

We have developed a software code that can automatically detect the brightest astronomical object and calculate the brightness from the FITS file images in each Seed# in the PhoSim Rubin (LSST) Simulated Survey #1 data sets. The code is written in Python and is called Object-Brightness Analyzer for Rubin Observatory (OBARO). The OBARO software can plough through and scan all the astronomical objects in each FITS file. It then identifies the brightest astronomical object in each image and calculates the mean pixel value and the brightness of that astronomical object, and the mean pixel value and brightness of the background in each FITS file image. Once the OBARO software runs all the FITS files in each Seed#, it will produce an output file in Excel for analysis. To manually to search, identify and make a catalog of the brightest astronomical object and determine brightness of that astronomical object, and brightness of the background in each FITS file image in each Seed# in the PhoSim Rubin (LSST) Simulated Survey #1 data sets can be cumbersome and time consuming using DS9. Using the OBARO software that can run on a PC or laptop, we can automate the process and do this task quickly. We will describe the OBARO software and present the results of brightness studies of astronomical objects in some of the PhoSim Rubin (LSST) Simulated Survey #1 data sets using Phosim versions 5.1.7 and 5.3.23.

When exposed to antibiotics for long enough, a bacterial population can evolve to become resistant. This prompts the creation of innovative therapeutics such as bacteriophage therapy. “Phage Therapy”, using doses of bacteriophage to combat infections, may be the new alternative to antibiotics. This research project aims to contribute to the genomic analysis of mycobacteriophages, a group of bacteriophages that infect Mycobacterium. Using Mathematica, a computational software created by Wolfram, GenFind - a gene prediction program - was made. To make predictions, a Support Vector Machine trained with the introns and exons of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis was implemented. A scoring matrix was created using codon frequency in coding versus non-coding regions in M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis. A query sequence, normalized by the scoring matrix, can be fed into a Support Vector Machine, which returns a numerical confidence score in both “gene” and “non gene” predictions. Another Support Vector Machine is used to score and classify the Shine-Dalgarno ribosomal binding site upstream of the start codon of an open reading frame. A full genome analysis finds every open reading frame in all 6 reading frames and displays only those that have a confidence score of 97.5% or greater. A single gene analysis does not include elimination of open reading frames with low scores. Instead, a display of the coding capacity and confidence scores are shown. This research has potential to aid in the discovery of cytotoxic genes and annotation of novel bacteriophage that can be used in phage therapy.

In the business world, the ability to analyze and predict customer engagement—when a customer shares their semantic responses (e.g., opinions, and emotion) to the brands or its products on the social media—is becoming increasingly significant, maintaining current customers, finding potential customers, promoting products and service innovation is one of the best ways to ensure business success. For this purpose, we studied 15,842 brand-themed usergenerated posts of Instagram to have better understand customer engagement behaviors for the popular posts in social media. We assessed how each of ten features (user comments, post descriptions, followers, brand categories, premium brands, brand relevance, brand commercials, post users, images, emoji) affect the machine learning prediction for customer engagement. The top 10 common machine learning models are applied to the proposed feature selection for predicting whether a customer likes or not a popular brand-themed user-generated post. Our findings indicate that the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model has the best recall (81%) of all of machine learning models, while also maintaining a high accuracy (90%). This high recall rate of the DNN model is important for the positive identification of popular posts in social media because identifying the maximal number of customers likely to engage in for the purpose of customer retention in a business environment increased recall is a good indicator of model fitness for marketing applications.

In natural communities, differences in life-history strategies among species allow for coexistence and help maintain biodiversity. One useful framework for understanding life history traits is Grimes C-S-R (Competitor-Stress Tolerator-Ruderal) model which has been well characterized in plants (Grimes 1974, 1977, 1979, 1988). However, it is less understood whether microorganisms demonstrate similar life-history strategies. In this study, we characterized life history traits associated with competitive abilities and stress tolerance of fungal root endophytes, which live intercellularly throughout plant root tissue and which can be mutualists or parasites in their hosts under different abiotic conditions. We measured in-vitro growth rates of 40 fungal endophyte taxa collected from roots of Ammophila breviligulata (American Beachgrass), across a resource availability gradient (4 levels of Carbon and Nitrogen availability) to address whether growth rates differed between rare and common fungal taxa under different resource conditions. We used image analysis to measure growth rates of fungal cultures every other day for 14 days. We found that fungal taxa that were common in field sites had higher growth rates on resource-rich media, showing better competitive abilities compared to rare taxa. Our results suggest that common taxa will continue to thrive and dominate root endophyte communities in a changing world where atmospheric nitrogen deposition is predicted to increase by three-fold in the next century.

In the past decade environmental DNA (eDNA) has become firmly established as an effective method for detecting the presence of organisms of research and conservation interest and promises to greatly increase the ease, efficacy, and scope of ecological studies. Salamanders of the genus Ambystoma are fossorial and rarely observed above ground outside of their reproductive seasons. Several members of this genus are of conservation concern and the conservation status of others uncertain, at least in portions of their range, as a result of limited data. Multiple species of the genus Ambystoma and Notophthalmus viridescens (eastern newt) often coexist in ephemeral ponds. We developed species-specific qPCR assays for Ambystoma texanum, Ambystoma talpoideum, and Notophthalmus viridescens based on mitochondrial gene sequences obtained from locally collected specimens and tested them in silico and in vitro. Tissue tests confirm specificity against sympatric species of the genus Ambystoma and other native salamanders. Additionally, primers were validated using tank water tests in the laboratory. These assays provide an effective means of determining species present in particular habitats rapidly and definitively and therefore offer to increase the ease of range delineation and spawning habitat studies.

Environmental DNA (eDNA) utilizes DNA released from aquatic organisms into the environment to detect their presence and provides an effective, non-invasive method to survey organisms in an efficient manner. This has generated considerable interest in the relationship between traditional sampling methods and eDNA, considering the potential benefits of eDNA in enhancing the ease of organism detection. We are surveying the salamander community of Maywoods Environmental and Educational Laboratory (Garrard and Rockcastle County, KY) using both traditional (leaf litter bags) and molecular (eDNA) assessment methods. Briefly, leaf litter bags have been placed at 3 m intervals at each sampling location and water samples are being collected biweekly below the lowest leaf bag at each site. Water samples are filtered in the lab within 24 hours and eDNA extracted following established laboratory protocols. End point PCR is being used to detect salamander DNA utilizing assays developed in our lab from cytochrome b sequences obtained from locally collected specimens. Preliminary data indicates detection of Eurycea cirrigera (southern two lined salamander) in leaf litter bags in two of three sites but in all three sites using eDNA. The final results should both provide interesting insight into the relationship between traditional and novel methods of amphibian detection and useful data concerning the species present in Maywoods Environmental and Educational Laboratory.

Characterizing optimal intraspecific trait variation in a larval salamander (Ambystoma maculatum). Ian E. Kratzer, Department of Biological Sciences, Eastern Kentucky University, 40475 Body size is a critical aspect of an organism's biological identity and is mediated by various biotic and abiotic factors. Theoretical models have demonstrated the ecological importance of body size using “single optima” approaches, which assign one optimal trait value per species and ignore the implications of intraspecific trait variation. Body size variation in particular significantly modifies the intensity and direction of interspecific and intraspecific interactions. Species with increased body size variation experience less intraspecific competition pressure due to niche partitioning while simultaneously experiencing higher risks of cannibalism and intraspecific aggression. Though these mechanisms are understood, their implications for optimal body size variation as an emergent property are unexplored and understanding size variation optima will improve characterization of agonistic interactions within populations. This study will seek to determine optimal levels of intraspecific body size variation in populations of larval salamanders. Eggs of Ambystoma maculatum will be hatched in climate chambers and combined with field-collected larvae to create varying levels of intraspecific body size variation in experimental mesocosms. Injury prevalence/severity and rates of larval growth and survival to metamorphosis will be used to generate a model of optimum intraspecific body size variation. This model will then be tested against natural populations by relating intraspecific larval body size variation to density at field sites. The model derived from mesocosms, and subsequent comparisons to natural populations, will allow for a better understanding of the ecological forces shaping intraspecific trait variation.

Belize is a small country in Central America known for its tropical climate and rich biodiversity. It is one of three countries that make up the Maya Forest, the largest protected forest in Mesoamerica which is connected in the north and south by the Maya Forest Corridor (MFC). Previous studies of biodiversity in the Maya Forest region relied on physical trapping of wildlife (e.g. box trapping) that is not only a labor intensive practice but, can be potentially harmful to wildlife. The current study will evaluate the effectiveness of camera trapping for studying biodiversity in Belize. The study was conducted at three sites, two of which are in the MFC and one of which is at the southern extent of the Maya Forest. Remote triggered cameras were set up in pairs, opposite one another, on trails that are highly trafficked by wildlife. Photos were captured, uploaded for analysis by hand, and labeled with the location attributed to each photo. Trends in time of day, temperature, habitat, and sociality among various species will be analyzed. In some cases, HotSpotter will be used to identify individuals using distinct spot patterns. A preliminary assessment of photos suggests that although an abundance of wildlife was captured on camera, time restraints with respect to the deployment of our cameras will not provide definitive evidence regarding all animals' trail use. Regardless, our study will hopefully shed light on the applicability of camera traps in supporting conservation initiatives that increase protection for wildlife in Belize.

Consumptive (direct) effects of predation have been well-studied in aquatic systems, but nonconsumptive (indirect) effects on prey have only recently received limited attention. Furthermore, tadpoles have traditionally been considered strict herbivores, leaving their roles as potential predators on aquatic invertebrates largely unexplored. The objectives of this study were to quantify omnivory among wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) tadpoles, determine their consumptive and non-consumptive effects on macroinvertebrate and zooplankton communities, and investigate whether such effects are mediated by habitat shading and tadpole body size. Tadpoles and egg masses were randomly sampled from 11 ponds in the Daniel Boone National Forest. Tadpoles were dissected and invertebrates in their gut contents were counted and identified. Eggs were reared to hatching in cattle tank mesocosms, and tadpoles were randomly assigned to be either caged within mesocosms or allowed to swim freely. Tadpoles were also divided into large or small size classes, and randomly assigned to either shaded or unshaded mesocosm treatments. Most tadpoles collected from natural ponds engaged in omnivory, primarily on zooplankton. Tadpoles in mesocosms exhibited both consumptive and nonconsumptive effects on macroinvertebrate and zooplankton communities, with invertebrate abundances generally being lower under shaded conditions and in the presence of larger tadpoles. Larger tadpoles in unshaded conditions also had higher survival and growth, respectively, suggesting that both invertebrate matter and algae/biofilms are important parts of the diets of some larval anurans. This study stresses the ecological importance of larval anurans, given their roles as predators of, and competitors with, aquatic invertebrate communities.

Urban agricultural landscapes are represented in a variety of spatially and temporally diverse forms, including rooftop gardens, city parks, community gardens, urban orchards, and private gardens. This type of city infrastructure provides important environmental services such as enhanced plant, insect, and animal biodiversity, high air quality, water regulation, carbon sequestration, and healthy soil. In addition, cities benefit from green zones in the social aspect, providing access to food security, farming and gardening, and cultural and educational opportunities. While city parks and community gardens have attracted a lot of attention from researchers in the last decade, much less research has focused on urban orchards as a potential multipurpose landscape to promote environmental health in cities. In this study, we assessed 9 sites across three types of urban green spaces (parks, community gardens, urban orchards) in Louisville, KY, during April-September 2021. We measured several aspects of biodiversity and ecosystem services including monthly surveys of lant diversity and abundance, tree physiological parameters (height, DBH), and crown health. These data were used to calculate stored carbon, yearly produced oxygen, and air pollution removal using the US Forest Service i-Tree software. On average, these urban orchards provided 559.3 pounds of carbon storage, 260.2 pounds of O2, and 2.3 pounds of air pollution removal yearly, as well as contained unique plant communities. Our results illustrate the importance of green zones in cities and fill a gap in knowledge on urban orchards in particular.

West Nile virus (WNV) is the most commonly transmitted mosquito-borne diseases infecting humans in the United States. Mosquitoes in the genus Culex are the primary vectors of WNV in the United States. Female Culex mosquitoes oviposit (lay eggs) on the surface of standing water in container habitats. Many factors of the container habitat can affect where egg rafts are laid. In this study, the influence of nutrient concentration, total nutrient content, and water volume on oviposition choice were examined using three semi-controlled field assays. Fifteen sites were used with three containers per site (n=5 sites per assay). For the first assay, five sites varied water volume (6, 12, 18 liters). For the second assay, five additional sites varied nutrient concentration (low, medium, high) in the water, and for the third assay, the last five sites varied total nutrient content (dilute, moderate, concentrated) in the water. Egg rafts were collected daily for twelve weeks, and larvae were identified to species. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to determine the fixed effects nutrient concentration, total nutrient contents, and water volume on oviposition choice. Oviposition choice is significantly influenced by all three main effects (water volume, nutrient concentration, and total nutrient content) with female Culex mosquitoes preferring medium to large volumes of water with moderate nutrient concentrations and total nutrient content. Understanding oviposition choice allows for better control of Culex mosquitoes by selectively targeting container habitats preferred by ovipositing females.

Eutrophication in aquatic systems results in algal blooms and subsequent oxygen depletion that leads to mass mortality events and alterations in aquatic community structure and function. However, many sublethal effects of eutrophication, such as behavioral changes in the absence of mortality, are poorly understood. Cope's Gray Treefrogs (Hyla chrysoscelis) minimize risk by selecting reproductive sites that exhibit reduced hydroperiods and predation risk, but eutrophication can present complex indicators of site quality. Although oxygen depletion often results from eutrophication, habitats with reduced oxygen are likely less to be colonized by aquatic predators. Additionally, moderately increased primary productivity due to eutrophication may benefit growth, as larval H. chrysoscelis are largely herbivorous, but such production may attract predators. To address these potentially conflicting cues of site quality, a mesocosm study was used to observe adult preference within a naturally occurring population between experimentally enriched treatment tanks and unmodified natural control tanks. Beginning in mid-summer, tanks were surveyed nightly for calling males and the following morning for oviposition occurrence. 167 instances of calling and 14 instances of oviposition were used to determine patterns of selection between males and females. Females were highly selective, with over 90% of eggs deposited in enriched tanks; males chose between treatment and control tanks indiscriminately and without an apparent preference. These results suggest males and females assess differing cues of site quality, which broaden our understanding of the sublethal effects of anthropogenic eutrophication in wetlands habitats.

Stream and wetland restoration and mitigation efforts have increased in the last 40 years. However, we have a limited understanding of the ecological structure and function of newly restored, mitigated, or created wetlands because of few post-restoration monitoring studies. The headwater valley of Slabcamp Creek in Eastern Kentucky is an example of a restored stream-wetland complex with unique, understudied habitats such as floodplain depressional ponds (FDPs). The objective of this study is to describe the wetland invertebrate assemblage structure within the FDPs of Slabcamp Creek's restored headwater valley. Fifteen ponds were randomly selected for invertebrate sampling in April 2021. Semi-quantitative samples were taken with a D-frame net. Qualitative samples were collected from vegetation and coarse woody debris. Invertebrates were sorted and identified to the lowest practical taxonomic level. Collections yielded 61 taxa and 4730 individuals. The most common taxa among ponds were Chironomini, Tanypodinae, and Oligochaeta, which aligns with previous studies of wetland ponds. Richness ranged from 6 to 27 taxa, and abundances ranged from 19 to 1892. Community structure analysis using nonmetric multidimensional scaling suggests hydroperiod is important. The results of this study will help establish a baseline for invertebrate assemblage structures within FDPs of restored headwater valleys and improve our understanding of restored wetlands.

Understanding human attitudes are critical for the successful implementation of wildlife conservation and management strategies. However, there have been no studies conducted in Eastern Kentucky to assess human attitudes towards wildlife conservation. The objective of this study was to identify the general attitudes of rural Appalachian Kentucky residents towards wildlife, nature, and ecotourism. We randomly administered a questionnaire to 119 residents in Martin County, KY. Several questions were a part of the survey, including questions on the resident's perceptions of statements regarding conservation and management. Of the participants surveyed, 68% were female, and 32% were male. The salient results of the survey include 97% of the respondents either strongly agreed or agreed that it is important to conserve nature for future generations. 87% of the respondents strongly agreed or agreed that ecotourism activities such as educational nature hikes would be beneficial to their community. 81% of the participants either strongly disagreed or disagreed with the statement that wildlife do not have the ability to feel emotions such as happiness, fear, or sadness. These results will be vital in managing wildlife populations in Eastern Kentucky and successfully involving the public in conservation and ecotourism decisions.

Majority of world's energy is generated from conventional resources such as fossil fuels. However, non-renewable resources take hundreds of years to replenish and are damaging to the environment. The harmful effects of non-renewable resources can affect humans and animals with the pollution that is created. Renewable energy is a viable option to reduce greenhouse gas emissions emitted by fossil fuels. One of the most prominent renewable energy is solar energy. The goal of this study is building a solar PV emulator that is can be used for laboratory purposes. This emulator has the characteristics of a real-time solar panel. Initially, a DC power supply, two rheostat resistor, multi-meters and Single-Diode PV Model were used to develop the emulator. Effect of solar radiation and the effect of temperature variation is studied by varying the resistor and source voltage respectively. Maximum power point is found when the rheostat resistor load is equals the rheostat resistor series based on the maximum power theorem. A Labview model was developed for a single PV cell and was expanded to a PV panel to study the characteristics of panel. User can give inputs such as temperature, solar radiation, cells in series and parallel, area and other key parameters to receive outputs such as energy generated and cost of the system. Currently, we are testing a programmable NI DC power supply RMX-4121 that is connected to a programmable NI RMX-4005 DC load and interfaced with Labview program to replicate I-V and P-V characteristics of solar PV panels.

Mankind has harnessed electricity from wind since 1887. The installation and maintenance of the wind turbines can prove to be time consuming, space consuming, and expensive, especially for education purposes. As wind velocity is intermittent in nature, having random variation, it yields variable mechanical power delivered by the wind turbine. Therefore, it is essential to analyze the performance of real wind energy before installing at the proposed site. Developing innovative solutions requires rigorous testing in laboratory conditions incorporating stochastic nature of renewable energy. Our project mimics the behavior of wind turbines within a laboratory. The emulator comprises a software component based on LabVIEW with a hardware interface of a motor driven generator which reproduces the same characteristics of a given wind turbine at any wind velocity. The emulator allows users to input values like the wind speed, pitch angle, temperature, and humidity which are fundamental in calculating the energy generated and provides results like torque, tip speed ratio, and coefficient of performance value of the wind energy conversion system. For the emulator, we plan to use DC motor to mimic the torque generated by the turbine. The power generated will be used on a load (either AC or DC). The user will also be able to interact with graphs using their choice of parameters. Since the project is set to for research and education purposes, the emulator system is placed on a cart which can be moved across the university campus easily.

Energy storage is a key element to provide reliable power using renewable energy sources. Hydrogen-based fuel cells have received increasing attention across energy sectors given their capability to provide storage for power grids. The aim of this project is to compare fuel cells to battery based on efficiency, performance and longevity. Hydrogen fuel cell components consist of an electrolyzer, hydrogen tank, and a fuel cell stack. Fuel cells generate electricity through an electrochemical reaction, known as reverse electrolysis. The fuel cell stack is the actual fuel cell component of the fuel cell system, which converts the given hydrogen and oxygen into electricity, water vapor and heat. The efficiency of fuel cell vs battery was conducted on a small fan as a load. The charging and discharging times of hydrogen fuel cells was compared with battery of similar voltage rating. The electrolyzer was powered for 2.5 minutes for hydrogen production while the battery was charged for 2.5 minutes. It was observed that the load operated for 1hr:14mins:53secs while the battery lasted only for 55 minutes. The experiment was repeated for 5-minutes. Fuel cell powered the load for 1hr:35mins:43secs whereas the battery is still being tested. A LabVIEW based simulation model was developed to study the characteristics of fuel cell such as current density versus cell voltage and others. The future scope of this project to develop a hydrogen-based fuel cell and compare it with battery-powered car.

The main goal/purpose of this project is to increase the amount of power generated by a Solar Panel(SP) by creating multiple models/designs to enhance the power generation. For this project, two designs were constructed, the Static Model, the Tracking Model, and the Reflector module. The Tracking Model uses electrical components to always face towards light. The hypothesis of this project is that the Tracking SP with the Reflector module will generate more power than the other models. This hypothesis was proved to be true. The data was collected throughout the day in sunlight from 9am to 5pm with time intervals every two hours, using a Multimeter to detect voltage and current produced. Overall, the Tracking Model with the Reflector module generated the maximum power output with 6.2 Volts and 600 mAh per time interval, charging one 2000mAh rechargeable battery in four hours, and almost 3 batteries in 12 hours.

An unsustainable amount of electrical power is consumed by numerous outdoor lighting systems across our region, causing the increase of carbon emissions and the diminishment of our environment. As the world pushes for more eco-friendly and efficient technologies, we strive to make our surrounding technologies produce negligible levels of emissions. In Northern Kentucky University's step towards carbon neutrality to be reached by 2050, we have seen it important that outdoor lighting on campus should be transitioned to solar power. This was decided upon based on the exponential improvements of solar photovoltaic technology in efficiency and cost. The current goal of this research is to convert four existing outdoor-lights to a solar-based smart lighting system. Three of these solar panels are mounted at various angles atop the lights, whereas the last one is in shade. Data is collected using Wi-Fi module communicators for six months in order to analyze and evaluate the optimal angle that is best suited to the geographical location and find how much energy is being produced and subsequently used. Each test bed includes motion and light dependent sensors to monitor movement of people or cars and control light intensity to save as much energy as possible.

The amount of electricity used by the outdoor light system cause many damages to both NKU and the surrounding environment. Some of the negative effects that are being created due to the excessive amount of electrical power caused by the existing outdoor lights include the destruction of our environment, and over usage of resources. Because of these problems, our study is focused towards making NKU more ecofriendly. With this, the goal of our project is to convert four existing outdoor lights in the lake Loch Norse into solar based outdoor lights using solar panels that will be positioned at different positions. One of the solar panels will be positioned at a certain angle. Another of the solar panels will be a single axis one which will have a sun tracking solar panel. The third solar panel will be a double axis one. The fourth solar panel will be in the shade. The solar panels will be programmed with a 24-hour counter which will identify what time it is throughout the day and also at what time the LDR and PIR sensors should be turned on and off. Wifi modules will be used to collect data which we will use to analyze what is the best angle. In addition to this, we will also figure out what is the amount of energy produced and used by the different solar panels placed around the Lake Loch Norse.

With the development of more ambitious, higher resolution, and higher data volume space-based exploration missions in the near-Earth domain, there is a need for higher rate downlink capabilities which must be facilitated for these missions in order for them to succeed. For large meetings or pathfinders, the ability to develop and test a ground station is a relatively trivial pursuit; however, that is not the case for small satellites such as CubeSats. These smaller missions rely heavily on COTS (commercial-off-the-shelf) components and modular systems that do not require a significant amount of overhead for the project. With this in mind, developing ground stations for these missions can be much more difficult and constrained than for larger satellite projects. The goal of the SHRUGS project is to develop, build and test an inexpensive Software Defined Radio-based ground station receiver system for data and telemetry processing for these small satellite missions. This ground-based receiver system will meet the following requirements: 1.) have a modular design, 2.) will include the RF front processing system that will accept an IF signal from the ground station antenna 3.) will have required controlling software and 4.) can be adapted to the specific requirements of the mission it will support. With this modularity and development from COTS components, the ground-based receiver system will be inexpensive to reproduce, will be highly capable, and will be a ready option for these high data volume/high data rate near Earth small satellites.

Epikarst systems are often very complex and dynamic, with storage, flow paths, and mixing dynamics considered highly variable. This research better characterizes the epikarst zone using high-resolution data in south-central Kentucky's Crumps Cave. Data and statistical analyses were applied to high-resolution geochemical data collected from a multi-parameter water quality sonde set to 10-minute intervals, isotope samples (18O/16O and 2H/H) collected on a weekly basis, and data loggers collecting discharge measurements between the years 2011-2018 at an epikarstic waterfall (WF1) and surface site. Weather data were collected at 10-minute resolution to aid in evapotranspiration calculations and to create a LMWL with precipitation amount-weighted isotope values. The results indicate a homogenizing effect in the isotopic signature at WF1, which implies mixing taking place in the epikarst zone. The LMWL deviated slightly from the GMWL due to relative humidity and evaporation differences shown by deuterium excess. Using these data, epikarst storage times are better understood to vary based upon storm intensity, precipitation amount, and evapotranspiration rates. The results of this study should help aid water management organizations to better understand the dynamics of this epikarst system leading to BMP's to provide greater protection for the water quality in agricultural settings relying on groundwater.

This research project revolves around a newly-discovered cave in Bowling Green, Kentucky. This cave, named Pit Stop Cave, was discovered during the investigation of the gasoline spill within Lost River Cave in 2019. The goal of this research is to study and understand the hydrologic connectivity of Pit Stop Cave within the Lost River Cave System. Several methods of investigation will be used to understand the role that the cave plays in the karst groundwater system as an epikarst input. These methods include cave survey to measure the extent of the cave, using fluorescent dyes to trace the flow route of water through the cave and its contribution to groundwater flow, and measuring water levels and water quality using dataloggers to collect continuous, high-resolution (1-minute) data on cave's hydrologic response during storm events. These data will also be used to analyze how the cave responds to rainfall, how fast it flows into the Lost River, and any residual water quality issues from the gasoline leak. The results will be shared with agencies within Bowling Green in order to improve contaminant monitoring and response planning for future spills or pollutants entering the system.

In early-stage or moderate eutrophication, respiration, death, and decomposition of primary producers depletes dissolved oxygen while still providing resources to tolerant species. In these systems, direct mortality may be low, while indirect effects of eutrophication dominate via changes in trophic or other behavioral interactions. These altered trophic interactions and structural diversity serve as bioindicators of eutrophication. Using a mesocosm approach, the effects of anthropogenic eutrophication on morphological responses in larval Wood Frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) and Green Frogs (Lithobates clamitans) were assessed. Significant environmental variation was induced which resulted in significant morphological variation, suggesting attempts to induce eutrophication were successful. Further, hypertrophic treatments may have fertilized enough to result in the positive parabolic relationships between primary productivity, and fertilization, tadpole size, and fin depth that are indicative of trophic collapse. However, primary productivity was unable to be correlated to post-treatment nitrate levels, and so future study would be needed into data from nitrate levels before and after our tadpole sampling. Increases in tadpole size and tail fin depth occurring due to increases in temperature and increased primary productivity could be attributed to increased predation risk due to eutrophication or increased availability of phytoplankton for tadpoles to consume.

Due to their extensive use, petroleum hydrocarbons are among the most common groundwater contaminants. The fate and transport of hydrocarbons in non-karst aquifers are impacted by natural attenuation processes, which contribute to contamination reduction. However, the occurrence of natural attenuation processes in karst aquifers is still understudied. Hereby, we present the initial results of the ongoing natural attenuation study at a newly discovered natural hydrocarbon seep (Lyda Well-1) in the urban karst environment in the City of Bowling Green, KY. Thus, the hydrochemistry of groundwater from Lyda Well-1 was analyzed immediately before and after the rainfall event on August 14, 2021 (17 mm of precipitation from 14:10 to 14:53). Due to the intense flushing of the well, concentrations of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) decreased from an initial 20.4 mg/l to <1.4 mg/l. Moreover, groundwater before the rainfall event was characterized by the lower content of electron-acceptors (O2=3.14 mg/l; NO3-=1.19 mg/l), and higher concentrations of biodegradation by-products (Mn=0.35 mg/l; Fe=2.6 mg/l). The second sampling campaign, after the rainfall event and freshwater recharge, reflects a shift towards groundwater hydrochemistry non-impacted by the presence of hydrocarbons. Thus, concentrations of biodegradation by-products decreased (Mn=0.12 mg/l; Fe=0.88 mg/l), while the content of electron-acceptors increased (O2=5.02 mg/l; NO3-=4.45 mg/l). These geochemical fingerprints have indicated a need for expanding this natural attenuation study by incorporating microbiological, biochemical, and isotopic methods.

Lonicera maackii is an introduced, invasion shrub that has successfully become the dominant understory species in many woodlands throughout central Kentucky. Consequently, L. maackii has negatively impacted native plant communities in forest ecosystems in Kentucky and surrounding region. The objective of this study was to evaluate the removal of Lonicera maackii followed by Elymus spp. seeding to facilitate native species recovery in a central KY forest understory dominated by L. maackii. In spring 2019, a randomized complete block experimental design with three replications was implemented. The following treatments were performed: a) untreated control; b) L. maackii removal with 20% (v/v) glyphosate cut-stump treatment; and c) L. maackii removal with 20% (v/v) glyphosate cut-stump treatment plus Elymus planting. Elymus spp. were seeded in December 2019 and plant communities were sampled in summer 2021. After nearly two years post-treatment, mean percent cover of L. maacki remained low (≤20%) in plots where it was removed and herbicide treated compared to untreated control plots. Moreover, Elymus cover averaged 50% or higher with slightly lower L. maacki cover compared to treatment plots where only L. maackii was removed and herbicide treated with no Elymus seeding. In addition, percent broadleaf plant cover was higher in L. maacki removal plots where Elymus was not seeded. Preliminary results from this study indicate L. maacki removal with cut-stump glyphosate treatment followed by Elymus seeding may help mitigate the reinvasion of L. maacki to facilitate the recovery of native plant communities in forests once dominated by L. maacki.

Karst groundwater quality is impacted by land use, and ingress of contaminants during storm events. Previous tracer tests identified two tributaries (Wheet and East Rivers) in the Hidden River Cave System (HRCS) and documented fast flow within 12-24 hours indicating close connections between surface inputs and groundwater. The speedy response times may result in high concentrations of contaminants surging through HRCS during heavy precipitation events. Contaminants pose a significant threat to the stygobiont populations of HRCS where die-off's have been documented, most recently in 2019. The purpose of this study was to document contaminant concentrations and geochemical response of the two streams during a storm event.

To measure parameters affecting the subterranean ecosystem, samples were collected hourly near the upstream confluence of the Wheet and East Rivers. Sampling was performed during a rain event on 6/4/21 and baseline samples were collected during normal flow conditions on 6/18/21. Analyses included temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, total suspended solids, specific conductivity, total chlorine, volatile organic compounds, chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, E. coli, oil and grease, anions, and cations. Preliminary results indicate differences in the geochemistry of the two streams and increased concentrations of certain parameters during peak storm flow, including bacteria and metals. The final data will be provided to the American Cave Conservation Association (ACCA) so they can work with their stakeholders to improve water quality in the Hidden River groundwater basin.

This record-breaking Late January winter storm impacted the lives of nearly all Kentucky residents. Crippling ice totals upwards of two inches, paired with snow, resulted in extremely dangerous conditions. Power outages, school and business closings, and lack of access to resources were problems for state resident for weeks after the winter storm. The impact this system has on Kentucky and surrounding regions was national news. By analyzing the Upper Air setup, Surface setup, and Skew-T Analyses, the synoptic discussion pages the way for this record-breaking storm. The historical significance of this winter storm is important as well, as timing, costliness, and impacts are nearly unmatched. A meteorological event with this magnitude of impact and devastation should be analyzed on a synoptic level to evaluate patterns that lead to these setups, so they can be better forecast in the future. The components that make up our atmosphere and weather conditions were favorable on these days to create such a winter storm and analyzing those is vital to acknowledging events like these in the future.

Environmental spills in karst regions are damaging and often go unnoticed until the issue has escalated to a point of affecting life or property. The field of emergency and environmental spill response lacks planning or preparedness focused on remediating groundwater contamination in karst systems. A lack of preplanning before an incident can lead to confusion, delayed response, and the inability to recover the contaminant. Due to the rapid movement of contaminants through urban karst groundwater aquifers, an efficient response plan that leverages localized data in a GIS must be developed and maintained in order to adequately respond. The objective of this study was to develop an adaptive response framework that includes data-driven preparedness and planning, a response plan template, and example mock drills for use by communities and emergency responders to assist in the response to urban groundwater contamination. Using the City of Bowling Green, Kentucky as a case study, where historical and modern gasoline leaks are prevalent, surveys and semi-structured interviews were conducted, along with participant workshop analysis, to inform the framework's development and integration of GIS into the emergency response planning for urban karst groundwater hazardous contamination events.

Mammoth Cave lacks hydrological data on the recharge/discharge dynamics of its primary spring outlets, Echo and Styx Springs, during varying moisture conditions and river reversal events. The Green River, which is the primary receiving stream for these springs, can backflood and reverse flow into the springs, causing an influx of river water that can cause contamination and influence the dissolution of the cave. Recharge dynamics of varying storm events and base-flow conditions are also not well understood between the two adjoining springshed basins for Styx and Echo. Data were collected from January 2021 and include weekly water samples for isotope and geochemical analyses at 13 sites on the surface and in-cave, water levels at six sites, and discharge data. These data were used to determine the conditions during which river reversals occur at the two springs and how epikarst and surface rainfall recharge the system during storm events to create competing hydraulic head pressures. River reversals appear to be moderated by cave recharge dynamics during certain flow conditions to a threshold at which the springs dominate the flow regime, while during high river discharge, the system exceeds this threshold and the Green reverses into the cave via the springs. Recharge points in the cave have varying geochemical signatures and indicate complex residence time dynamics that control the discharge during different seasons and antecedent moisture conditions. These results have implications for the management of the cave system and adjacent Green River with respect to a variety of hydrologic and biological parameters.

Kenya has historically been vulnerable to disasters such as riverine floods and flash floods. For a country that depends on agriculture for over a third of its gross domestic product, these floods pose a national threat to the economy and food security. The Kisumu region is a large producer of food crops thanks to quality soils of two rainy seasons. While the region already has a few strategies to cope with the disaster risk of floods, there is a gap between the time a flood forecast is released and the time the first actions are taken to mitigate the impacts of the flood. This project aims to explore whether or not soil moisture can be used as an additional indicator, along with streamflow forecasts, to identify the potential impacts of floods in agricultural areas of Kisumu. We used 7-day historical streamflow forecasts to identify two similar flooding events that occurred in different years. Soil moisture wetness values for these events were determined using a SMAP L4 product. We created daily composites for every day, two weeks out ahead of each chosen flood event using geotiffs from the SMAP product. After charting and correlating the necessary values, we found there was not enough evidence to conclude that there was significant flood inundation within our watershed.

Research indicates that heavier downpours have been occurring more frequently across the SE US over the last couple of decades. A significant storm characteristic related to heavier downpours includes rainfall erosivity, defined as the capability of rainfall to cause soil erosion from a surface. Currently the average long-term annual and seasonal rainfall erosivity for a location may be obtained from isoerodent maps calculated from a sample of climate stations across the US. However, at the state scale these measures are sporadic, often only utilizing a handful of stations per state and use rainfall data from an increasingly outdated period of time which may not reflect possible changing storm characteristics over sub-annual time frames. Using 5 minute precipitation data across 2011-2020 from the Kentucky Mesonet system, we conducted a quantitative spatial and seasonal analysis of several key storm characteristics, including total storm precipitation, duration, erosivity, and max 5 and 30 min rainfall-intensity. Initial results indicate significant differences in many storm characteristics between the state's climate divisions and seasonally. Storm erosivity, duration and intensity were all greatest during summer and in most cases displayed a significant decrease along a west to east gradient. Recent storm erosivity also increased across each season for the majority of Mesonet stations compared to the historical normals.

On the evening of March 2, 2020, many residents of Tennessee went to sleep knowing that a few severe thunderstorms were possible overnight. That night, several strong tornadoes touched down, impacting several communities and cities, including Nashville, Tennessee. The worst of the tornado damage occurred in Cookeville, Tennessee, where an EF-4 tornado touched down, causing widespread damage and, unfortunately, several deaths. Homes throughout the area were destroyed, and nearly knocked off of their foundations. Unlike other outbreaks that have occurred over the past few years, this outbreak was not expected to produce several tornadoes of strong intensity. The Storm Prediction Center originally anticipated that a cap would help to keep large severe storms from becoming too strong throughout the day, but throughout the nighttime hours, the ingredients came together to cause an outbreak of severe weather and tornadoes.

The objective of our work was to develop a two-step classification system to first differentiate between malignant renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and benign renal masses. After, malignant tumors were sent to the second stage to be classified as clear cell(cc) RCC or non-clear cell. Classification of renal tumor's stage and subtype is usually determined through biopsy. However, computer aided diagnosis (CAD) and machine learning provide a safer more cost effective method of differential diagnosis. The patient cohort included 140 individuals aged 15-87 years, with 70 malignant tumors and 70 benign masses. All patients underwent biopsy, and of the 70 malignant masses 40 were found to be ccRCC and 30 nccRCC. Subjects were scanned on a multiphase CTscan that included a pre-contrast, portal-venous, and delayed-contrast phase. Scans were then put through the RC-CAD system. The RC-CAD system entailed three main steps renal tumor preprocessing (segmentation), feature extraction, and the final two-step classification system using an artificial neural network system. Akaike's information criterion (AIC) was used to compare the efficacy of each feature category. Sixteen models were created for both classification steps. The first step of classification, differentiating between malignant and benign masses, was found to have the best efficiency with a sensitivity of 87%, specificity of 91%, and AUC of 0.98. The second stage, differentiating between ccRCC and non-ccRCC malignant masses, had a lower sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 53%. These results suggest first stage classification may be applied to clinical settings though malignant tumor subtype cannot be determined.

Though on the decline in a majority of the American population, cigarette smoking remains as one of the deadliest, preventable causes of death. Furthermore, maternal smoking while pregnant remains a problem, especially in Kentuckian mothers. The effects of maternal smoking on fetal development and wellbeing are well documented, however less is understood on how multiple insults (such as high fat diet) could further alter fetal development. Our laboratory tested differences in gene expression in hepatic tissue collected from adult C57BL/6 mice of both sexes. These mice were exposed to either cigarette smoke or filtered air and were fed either a high- or low-fat diet for 4 months starting at postnatal day 50. We tested a plethora of gene targets using RT-PCR, including those involved in gluconeogenesis, lipid metabolism, and glycolysis. Our experimentation found sex dependent, diet dependent, and cigarette smoke exposure dependent effects, as well as interactions of these 3 factors, within the collected hepatic tissue. These findings indicate that these variables do influence mRNA expression in the liver and thus possibly overall liver function.

Probiotics are live microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts, can confer health benefits to the host. Probiotics and supplements containing probiotics have attracted considerable interest due to their claimed health benefits. Some genera, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species, are commonly used as starter cultures for dairy products, such as kefir, yogurt, etc., as well as many dietary supplements. Although several studies suggest probiotics can be an effective in development of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and other side effects, many in vitro studies report significant evidence indicating the presence of antibiotic-resistance determinants (ARD) in Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species, which can potentially make them a reservoir of antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs). Although the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) categorizes probiotics as “Generally Recognized As Safe” (GRAS), the latest Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS) established by the European Food Safety Authority indicates they should be used with caution because of their ARDs, which increases risk of horizontal as well as vertical transfer of antibiotic resistance to other related and unrelated species. One of the goals of this multidisciplinary project is to determine Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) of 10 clinically used antibiotics for probiotic bacteria isolated from commercially available supplements. Isolates were plated on Brucella Blood agar plates and incubated with ten E-Test antibiotic strips, maintained under anaerobic conditions at 370C for 72 hours, in duplicates. Most isolates were resistant to Cefotaxime, Astreonam, and Trimethoprim. This is an on-going study and more data will be presented.

Analysis of trace volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath has the potential of becoming a powerful noninvasive tool in evaluating inhaled toxicants and diagnosing disease including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancers, bacterial and viral infections. However, there are several challenges currently limiting breath analysis for clinical applications. Challenges include identifying trace volatile aldehydes and ketones associated with disease biochemical processes and reducing the interference of other VOCs in exhaled breath. Chemoselective capture of carbonyl VOCs in human breath has been accomplished by the development of a novel microreactor approach. Innovations in this approach permit the quantitative analysis of both ketones and aldehydes by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The purpose of this study is to compare a new reagent 4-(2-aminooxyethyl)-morpholin-4-ium chloride (AMAH) coated microchips with the current reagent 2-(aminooxy)ethyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium iodide (ATM) loaded microchips for capture of carbonyl VOCs in exhaled breath. Reagents are characterized by their capture of deuterated compounds including propionaldehyde-d2 and 2-butanone-d5. Obtained results will facilitate the analysis of volatile ketones and aldehydes in exhaled breath by GC-MS.

PRL-3 is an oncogenic phosphatase upregulated in a multitude of cancers with roles in tumorigenesis and metastasis. Despite the number of studies into the roles of PRL-3 in cancer, incomplete structural information, a shallow and hydrophobic binding pocket, and a high degree of homology between its family members has made it challenging to therapeutically target PRL-3. Recently, we have developed PRL-3 specific nanobodies as a novel research tool to study PRL-3. We have shown these nanobodies are highly specific for PRL-3 over other proteins. In the current project we are further developing these PRL-3 nanobodies as research tools and anti-cancer therapeutic compounds. Towards this end, PE38, a bacterial immunotoxin, was fused to the PRL-3 specific nanobody by the traditional insertional cloning into a bacterial expression construct pSKB3. It is hypothesized that nanobody guided immunotoxin can bring about cell death exclusive to PRL-3 expressing cells. This strategy, if successful, can be used as a translational approach to target PRL-3. The Nanaobody-PE38 fusion protein was purified using the standard Ni-NTA system. The protein was then tested on PRL-3 over-expressing cells in a dose dependent treatment ranging from 10ng/ml to 0.1mg/ml for 24 hours and assessed for cell viability using the CellTiter-Glo assay. The results showed no change in the cell viability after treatment with Nanobody-PE38 at 24 hours. Current research is focused on optimization of the dosage and duration of the treatment, assessment of changes in nanobodyPE38 affinity to PRL-3, and testing the efficacy of different toxic compounds coupled to PRL-3 nanobody.

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a rare but severe adverse reaction to certain drugs, e.g., antibiotics and aromatic anticonvulsant drugs. Furthermore, its delayed onset, varied clinical presentation, and prolonged duration make the diagnosis and prognosis difficult. To find out if there are common factors, we conducted an extensive literature search, followed by a meta-analysis. A total of 12,146 peer-reviewed publications were found from PubMed, after using these search keywords: “DRESS”, “DRESS or DHIS”, “Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms”, and “Drug-Induced hypersensitivity syndrome”. These publications were examined, and 83 cases/patients were identified that had associated information regarding the gender, age, specific symptoms, causative agents or drugs, and the treatment. We conducted meta-analyses to determine if there are common factors associated with DRESS, the treatments, and their outcomes. These results will be presented and discussed. The aim is to provide evidence for better recognition and detection, and their causes, hence improving the diagnosis and reducing the risk, respectively.

Fragmented sleep is commonly observed in humans suffering from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Sleep regulates immune responses, including inflammatory responses. Using mouse models, we have previously reported that sleep fragmentation (SF) induces an increase in pro-inflammatory gene expression in peripheral and brain tissue. Glucocorticoids are also released during SF and are considered anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive at high doses but may stimulate immune function on an acute level. We hypothesized that glucocorticoids are involved in regulating these inflammatory responses during acute SF. To investigate this, C57BL/6J male and female mice were subjected to adrenalectomy (ADX), ADX + Corticosterone, sham-ADX or sham-ADX + Corticosterone, followed by a week of recovery. Mice were then subjected to acute (24 h) SF and thereafter, peripheral (liver, spleen, heart, adipose, trunk blood) and brain (prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus) tissues were collected. Corticosterone ELISAs were used to assess circulating corticosterone concentration. RTPCR was used to assess pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in peripheral tissues and brain. The results obtained from this study will help identify potential pathways mediating inflammatory responses that could lead to better therapeutic treatments for OSA. We thank the NIH (#R15GM117534-02) and Western Kentucky University (Graduate Student Research grant) for funding this research.

In December 2019, there was an outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Clinical cases of infected patients range from mild disease to critical illness, and certain underlying conditions increase the risk of severe outcomes. Many COVID-19 patients require mechanical ventilation or die during hospitalization. Machine-learning models can help physicians quickly identify these high-risk patients. For this study, a comprehensive machine-learning workflow was used to analyze clinical data from 471 COVID-19 patients at University of Louisville hospital and develop a machine-learning-based predictive model. The R programming language was used to create a dataframe of clinical COVID-19 data, visualize the data, and perform statistical tests. Machine-learning models were trained and validated through k-fold cross validation. Model performances were estimated by areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves, and variables were ranked based on importance to the models. An ensemble method of feature selection was applied to a stacked ensemble machine-learning method to find the optimal predictive model for each outcome. Machine-learning-based approaches can inform us about which risk factors are most relevant for predicting disease outcomes. Training machine-learning models on a set of clinical COVID-19 data revealed valuable information about associations between certain predictor variables and severe patient outcomes. The information obtained in this study can be used to work towards the long-term goal of stratifying patients based on risk factors for better management of patient care during respiratory virus pandemics.

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are environmental pollutants associated with different cancers in PCB-exposed population. Our research group demonstrated that long-term exposures to the PCB mixture, Aroclor 1260, at low, environmentally-relevant doses led to liver tumor incidences in male mice. However, similar studies are lacking in female models and need to be addressed. The objective of the current study is to evaluate sex-dependent effects of low-dose PCB exposures, on carcinogenic endpoints, using a throughput Omics approach. Male and female C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to a mix of Aroclor1260 (20 mg/kg) and PCB126 (20 µg/kg) p.o for 2 weeks. Hepatic tissue was collected for peptide measurements (LC/MS); Proteome data was analyzed using Statistical Analysis Tool for Proteomics software; and computational downstream analysis was performed using MetaCore software. Phenotypic results demonstrated that female mice were more susceptible to PCB-induced liver toxicity (steatosis, inflammation and dyslipidemia) vs. males. Proteomics analysis revealed distinct hepatic proteomes dependent on sex and exposure. Out of 3665 proteins analyzed, 297 proteins (197↑,100↓) were altered in PCB-exposed males vs. females. Enrichment Ontologies for Disease (by Biomarkers) analysis and Transcription Factor Analysis (TFA) revealed key cancer endpoints upregulated in PCB-exposed females, including several forms of intestinal and lung/bronchi cancers. Notably, TFA demonstrated that PCB-exposed female mice had increased activation for oncogenic factors including c-Jun and b-Myb. Taken together, the preliminary data suggest that PCB-exposed females exhibited higher cancer endpoints. More extensive evaluation of cancer biomarkers is needed. Our follow-up studies will evaluate the effects of long-term PCB exposures on liver cancer endpoints. This research was supported, in part, by the NIH (2R25CA134283, R35ES028373, P20GM113226, R21ES031510, R01ES032189, P30ES030283, and P42ES023716).

Recently, many people have developed eating habits resembling a “Western diet”: a diet consisting of high amounts of processed foods, red meats, fried foods, and foods high in fat and sugar, which has been shown to lead to obesity. The following research proposal investigates how obesity alters metabolism and impairs immune function, affecting early-onset colorectal cancer (CRC) risk rates. It considers five BMI categories (underweight, healthy, overweight, obese, and morbidly obese) and six ethnic groups (Hispanic, African American, Caucasian, Asian, American Indian, and Pacific Islander). There will be a total of 120,000 participants, between the ages 25 and 45, who have been US residents for at least 5 years. The five BMI categories will consist of 4,000 participants from each of the six ethnic groups, totaling to 24,000 participants per BMI category and 20,000 participants per ethnic group. The participants will be followed for 15 years and each year they will have one follow-up in a clinic/lab, where data will be collected for the analysis stage. This proposal suggests that diets resembling a “Western Diet” will lead to higher weight and BMI, resulting in lower resting metabolic rate and metabolic syndrome (altering metabolism), and an abnormal amount of immunoglobulin (impairing immune function). Overall, this is expected to lead to a higher risk for early-onset CRC. The results of this study will ultimately help us understand how diet and weight affects risk for early-onset CRC and how we can alter our lifestyles to lower our risk.

Neural crest cells are involved in forming multiple tissues in the body. The periocular mesenchyme is a subgroup of neural crest cells that forms the anterior segment of the eye, which includes the lens, cornea, and the iris. In the Famulski lab, zebrafish were used as the model organism to study these periocular mesenchyme cells on the molecular level. The periocular mesenchyme cells were isolated, and a single cell transcriptome analysis identified the genes highly expressed by the cells. Si:ch211-251b21.1 and hgd were two genes identified in the single cell transcriptome analysis. Si:ch211-251b21.1 is suspected to be a glutamate receptor of the Kainate family, while hgd is involved in phenylalanine metabolism and hence pigment synthesis. Knocking out both genes with the CRISPR Cas9 system resulted in particular phenotypes that included maldevelopment of the anterior segment. My project focused on the role of the potential glutamate receptor si:ch211-251b21.1 and hgd for eye development. The kainate receptor and hgd in zebrafish embryos were inhibited with drugs known from previous studies. After drug exposure, in situ hybridizations were performed to examine if the drugs had an impact on the expression and function of si:ch211-251b21.1 and hgd.

Aspalathus linearis (Burm. f.) R.Dahlgren (Leguminosae; common name: rooibos tea) is a plant indigenous to South Africa. It is known to possess medicinal benefits for hyperactive states of the gut and respiratory tract. The aim of this study was to provide scientific basis for some of these claims. Fermented variety of rooibos tea was brewed in water and then dried to obtain an extract (Al.Cr). Effects of Al.Cr were explored on isolated smooth muscle tissue preparations of guinea-pig ileum and rabbit trachea. Al.Cr was administered on the resting quiescent baseline of ileum where it did not show any stimulant effect up to 10 mg/ml. Later, it was tested, in increasing concentrations, on K+ 80- and 25-mM induced contractions. The extract was unable to suppress these sustained contractions indicating absence of any Ca2+ antagonist or K+ channel opening (KCO) activity. In previous experiments done in isolated rabbit jejunum, rooibos extract exhibited a relaxant effect predominantly mediated via a KCO mechanism. When tested against acetylcholine (ACh) concentration-response curves, Al.Cr suppressed these from 1-5 mg/ml in guinea-pig ileum. The extract was also able to produce complete suppression of carbachol-induced contractions in isolated rabbit trachea from 1-10 mg/ml. The results show a spasmolytic effect of Al.Cr in guinea-pig intestinal tissues that was not mediated via suppression of K+ induced contractions. It points towards the use of rooibos as an antidiarrheal. Al.Cr also exhibited a tracheal relaxant effect that is related to the use of this herb in airway hyperresponsiveness.

Angiogenesis is the growth of new blood vessels, and it is vital to the human body because blood vessels provide nutrients to our cells. Anti-angiogenesis is a process of blocking the growth of new blood vessels. Anti-angiogenic drug in cancer treatment prevents the growth of new blood vessels in tumors by binding to VEGF molecules, which otherwise, disrupt endothelial cells inside the blood vessels causing the sprouting of existing blood supply towards the tumor (Oliver et al.). Preventing the growth of new blood cells will deprive the tumor of nutrients, thus decreasing its carrying capacity, and ultimately shrinking its volume. With new vascularization absent, the tumor will be isolated, making it easier to treat. Although there are various anti-angiogenic drugs, their effectiveness is low compared to other cancer treatments. If there could be a way to increase the effectiveness of anti-angiogenic drugs, majority of cancer could be treated with an increased survival rate and the human body would not undergo as much damage as it does when going through other treatment modalities mainly radiotherapy and chemotherapy. We are aiming to explore clinically viable control factors which will ultimately force the growth of carrying capacity and tumor volume to acquire the saturation after some time. Specifically, we are pinpointing those control factors which can compensate for low success rate of Bevacizumab, a FDA approved anti-angiogenic drug, for the treatment of Ovarian Cancer. These control factors will be added in the growth model of carrying capacity and tumor volume and numerically analyzed.

Short-term muscle weakness is caused by a range of factors, normal and abnormal. Under normal condition, rigorous exercise is a common cause of muscle fatigue, characterized by a decrease in muscle movement. Specific medical conditions can also affect muscle weakness, leading to feeling of fatigue and weakness. This study examined muscle fatigue during a short-term hunger state, using EMG recordings. A hypothesis was that muscle activity would be lower during a short-term hunger state, compared to no-hunger state, with a greater decrease in females. A state of short-term hunger was defined 4-6 hours without food and no-hunger state within 30 minutes after food consumption. EMG recordings of the arm were done for 2 minutes during two phases: resting and fatigue. Resting state was before curling of a 10-pound dumbbell. Fatigue state was after curling when subjects felt fatigue and weakness. The number of spikes measured muscle activity of the arm used for curling and data were compared. Overall, there was a non-significant trend with a decreased muscle activity during short-term hunger state, compared to no-hunger state. Compared to males, females showed a slight decrease in muscle activity, particularly when fatigued during hunger state. Present findings suggest that a short-term hunger state or food deprivation may lead to a decrease in muscle activity, leading to greater fatigue and weakness, which may be greater in females. Currently, we are examining sex differences in muscle activity during a longer-term hunger state.

Trigonella foenum-graecum Linn. (Fabaceae; common name fenugreek) is a medicinal plant known all over the world for its medicinal properties. It is regarded by traditional healers in South Asia for its gastrointestinal (GI) benefits and memory enhancing properties. In this report, we present the effect of fenugreek seed extract on isolated GI smooth muscles and in vitro acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme. Fenugreek seeds were soaked in 70% aqueous methanol. The filtrate was collected, and then concentrated in an evaporator. A thick extract (Tfg.Cr) was obtained. This extract was tested on isolated tissue preparations of jejunum and ileum obtained from rabbits and rats respectively. Isolated tissues were mounted in tissue baths with physiological salt solution. Tfg.Cr, when tested on baseline of rabbit jejunum and rat ileum, did not exhibit any stimulant or relaxant activity up to 10 mg/ml. This is interesting as traditionally fenugreek is used in GI motility disorders. When Tfg.Cr was tested for AChE inhibitory activity, it did show an inhibitory effect from 47-380 µg/ml. Physostigmine, a standard AChE inhibitor, also showed a similar inhibitory effect. One of the known chemicals from fenugreek, diosgenin, was also tested and it also showed an AChE inhibitory effect from 11-190 µg/ml. The results showed that fenugreek extract does not possess any GI stimulant or relaxant activity although it did inhibit the AChE enzyme pointing towards its potential for memory enhancement.

Middle school students often struggle with mathematics because they cannot readily comprehend real-world applications for the discipline. Mathematics education students designed a Legacy Cycle Problem Based Unit of Instructions centered around the Pythagorean Theorem. In the problem-based unit middle school students must defeat a diabolical video game “boss” who has trapped students inside a “Sword Art” video game. The only way to conquer the “boss” and escape the alternative reality is to complete all of the video game “floors” by solving problems related to the Pythagorean theorem and distance formula. This standards-based unit inspires children to persist in problem-solving and models the work conducted by computer programmers and video game designers. Attendees will learn the steps of the Legacy Cycle as applied to problem-based instruction, experience an overview of the teaching unit and will receive a link to the lesson materials in this STEM instructional unit.

We are interested in a competitive version of the well known game 20 questions, where two players choose an item from a given finite personalized group and then alternatingly ask yes/no questions to find out the item. The winner is who finds the item first. We investigate the probability p(k, n) of the first player to win the game if the number of choices is k for the first players item and n for the second players. We prove the recursion formula p(k, n) = max 1≤y.

This presentation examines the dynamics of disease transmission using computational methods. A compartmental model was developed to represent the various disease-states of a population, as well as vaccination status, masking, and risk-averseness/tolerance. Euler's method was used to find approximate solutions to the system of first-order differential equations governing this compartmental model. The model was applied to a population approximately the size of Morehead State University with various epidemiological parameters being estimated from state and national data. By comparing various possible parameter values and population behaviors, the results of this model are compared with actual Morehead State University COVID-19 case numbers.

Polynomial mating is a process of taking two postcritically finite polynomials and creating a new function imitating the dynamics of a rational function. This is a difficult operation to perform, especially when working with Misiurewicz polynomials. There are three possible Misiurewicz polynomials with fewer than five postcritical points up to dynamic equivalence. Instead of using an analytic process of mating, a combinatorial process of mating is possible between these maps using their associated Hubbard tree. This paper explores the dynamics of matings between these three polynomials using finite subdivision rules on joined Hubbard trees to make the process of polynomial mating more computationally accessible.

We consider Finite Difference and Finite Element semi-discretizations (approximations) of the infamous one-dimensional wave equation describing vibrations on a clamped-free string. The corresponding partial-differential-equation (PDE) model is known to be uniformly controllable by one boundary controller applied at the tip of a string. However, semi-discretized approximations (system of ODEs) are not stabilizable without proper filtering. Therefore, a dynamic boundary controller together with an indirect filtering are introduced in the talk. We show both the boundary feedback stabilization of a vibrating string utilizing the filtered finite difference method (FDE) and the filtered finite element method (FEM with linear splines. These solutions were built to fit the equations in a custom manner such that all control parameters and even initial equations, i.e., a box-type, pinch-type, sinusoidal, sawtooth-type, with high and low frequencies that can be manipulated via a Mathematica program (called Wolfram Demonstration). We were able to find that the results from the discretizations matched what was happening in the real world. The demonstrations and codes being used in the presentation will be submitted for publication at the Wolfram' Demonstration Project website similar to Demo 1 and Demo 2.

The partial differential equation (PDE) model for a three-layer Mead-Marcus beam is considered. This model describes the uniform transversal vibrations on a composite beam consisting of a complaint layer in between two outer stiff layers. Using the non-harmonic Fourier series method, the PDE model with hinged boundary conditions is shown to be exactly observable with single boundary observation. But the space-discretized Finite-Difference approximations of the PDE model do not retain the uniform exact observability as the mesh parameter goes to zero. The main reason is the loss of the uniform gap (as the mesh parameter goes to zero) among the spurious high-frequency eigenvalues of the Finite-Difference discretization of the operator -∂x2 with clamped boundary conditions. As a remedy, these high-frequency spurious eigenvalues are filtered by the direct Fourier filtering method, so that the filtered approximations retain uniform observability of all types of vibrations on the beam. In this talk, open problems will be also discussed.

The UmuDAb and DdrR proteins coregulate error-prone polymerases in the multi-drug resistant opportunist, Acinetobacter baumannii by repressing polymerase expression until after DNA damage. However, recent evidence suggests that they may also regulate genes repressed by DNA damage and phenotypes related to growth inhibition after DNA damage. We therefore re-analyzed our previously acquired RNA-Seq data from wildtype, ddrR, and umuDAb mutant strains to examine the expression requirements of DNA damage-repressed and putative cell division genes. Cuffnorm- or HTSeq- normalized counts were analyzed with Cuffdiff or DESeq2, and q values < 0.05 were considered to be differentially expressed after DNA damage. We identified 35 putative cell division-related genes in the KEGG database. We observed derepression of site-specific tyrosine recombinase xerC and induction of topoisomerase IV/Type II toxin(/antitoxin) parE in both mutants, and derepression of septal ring lytic transglycosylase rlpA in the ddrR mutant. XerC and ParE function at a DNA damage-associated filamentation locus in Escherichia coli, and XerC also interacts with cell septum protein FtsK. RT-qPCR experiment confirmed this ddrR dysregulation in parE. Nineteen (CuffDiff) or 29 (DESeq2) genes repressed in wildtype cells were derepressed in either the umuDAb and/or the ddrR mutant strain after DNA damage. Among these were an induced acetoin metabolism operon A1S_1700-1703, a putative YfbU family member (required for MazF-mediated cell death after DNA damage), rlpA, and cold-shock protein A1S_1228. Further RT-qPCR verification experiments will help test whether DdrR and UmuDAb control these genes with roles in this opportunistic pathogen's response to DNA damage and stress.

The field of medicine encounters increasingly more bacteria that are resistant to available antibiotics every day. Annually, in the U.S., approximately 2.8 million people develop an antibiotic-resistant infection, resulting in more than 35,000 deaths. With this, the need to ascertain new, effective antibiotics is at an all-time high. Tiny Earth is a collection of instructors and students focused on the discovery of antibiotics from the soil. The goal of this research was to analyze isolates from past class samples using methods from Tiny Earth. The isolates were tested for antibiotic production against nine ESKAPE pathogen relatives. Those displaying antibiotic production were, then, subjected to biochemical and molecular testing. PCR was performed on the 16S rRNA gene and confirmed using agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR samples were used for Sanger sequencing, and these sequences were utilized to determine the likely identity of each isolate. Extraction was executed on an isolate shown to produce a broad-spectrum antibiotic, which allowed for optimization of the protocol and testing of different concentrations of extracts. Thirteen isolates produced antibiotics against one or more of the ESKAPE relatives, biochemical results were found to be quite diverse, and BLAST was utilized to identify the isolates. This initial testing sets up further examination of these isolates including bacterial inhibition testing with purified chemicals, host toxicity testing with eukaryotic cells, and structural characterization with chemical analysis. The data collected during this research project is a small yet positive step to combat the issue of antibiotic resistance.

The error-prone DNA damage repair response of SOS mutagenesis in Acinetobacter baumannii bacteria occurs after the self-cleavage of the UmuDAb repressor and induction of error-prone polymerases. UmuDAb co-regulates these polymerases with the DdrR protein through an unknown mechanism. Our goal was to learn whether DdrR contributes to the DNA binding and repression actions of UmuDAb, or the self-cleavage that removes UmuDAb repression. First, we constructed three A. baumannii strains with site-directed mutations in these UmuDAb activities. We then compared the SOS mutagenesis frequencies in these mutants to the frequencies observed in ddrR/umuDAb double mutants. Cells were irradiated with 200 J/m2 of UV-C light and re-grown overnight, as were untreated cells. These cultures were plated onto media both with and without the antibiotic rifampin as a measure of the SOS mutagenesis mutation frequency. The fold-increase of mutation to rifampin resistance of treated and untreated cells was compared. Neither of the two DNA binding mutations nor the ddrR mutation significantly impacted SOS mutagenesis compared to the high levels observed in wild-type cells. ddrR mutation also had no significant impairment on SOS mutagenesis when combined with the two umuDAb DNA binding mutants. We observed that SOS mutagenesis was rare in umuDAb self-cleavage mutants and umuDAb cleavage/ddrR double mutants. These results indicated that the DdrR protein does not aid in the self-cleavage of umuDAb but may have a mechanism of action that affects UmuDAb repression activities.

When eukaryotes first evolved, a transition occurred from circular chromosomes to linear chromosomes. The ends of chromosome have protective caps comprised of DNA repeats called telomeres. Telomeres play key roles in two of the biggest problems in modern medicine: aging and cancer. As individuals age, telomeres shorten due to an inability to fully copy the chromosome ends during replication. In contrast, the enzyme telomerase is upregulated in cancers to maintain telomere length and allow the unending cellular proliferation characteristic of this disease. The goal of our work is to explore the evolution of chromosomes and unravel the mystery of why telomeres and telomerase evolved. Specifically, we are trying to circularize the linear chromosomes in the single-celled eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Briefly, our genetic engineering strategy involves building DNA cassettes, inserting them into the left and right arms of a single chromosome, then allowing a recombination event to connect the ends. To date, I have confirmed integration of left and right arm cassettes into their respective arms of Chromosome IV, the longest of the 16 linear chromosomes in S. cerevisiae. From these double integrants, I detected circularization by PCR across the new circular junction. This represents the first time a single chromosome has been successfully circularized using a genetic engineering approach. I am now working to characterize the fitness and mating ability of these circular Ch. IV strains. Ultimately, our goal is to shed light on the evolution of linear chromosomes and how eukaryotes benefit from their selection over circular chromosomes.

MooMoo is a temperate mycobacteriophage that was isolated from a water sample in Kentucky. Based on published evidence that phages encode proteins that are toxic when overproduced, we hypothesized that MooMoo may encode genes that are toxic to Mycobacterium smegmatis host cells. Five genes (gp87, g8, gp89, gp90, and gp91) were chosen for analysis because they have no known function. Each gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into an Escherichia coli/M. smegmatis shuttle/expression vector, pExTra, by isothermal ligation. The resulting recombinant plasmids were propagated in E. coli and verified by PCR. Each construct was then moved into M. smegmatis cells. The expression of the cloned genes was induced and the effect on cell growth was monitored. The toxicity of each gene was then scored on a Toxicity Index (TI) from 0–5, with 0 corresponding to no toxicity (abundant growth) and 5 representing the strongest toxicity (no growth). Gp87 displayed the strongest toxicity and was chosen for further analysis. The next step is to determine how gp87 interferes with M. smegmatis growth by performing a protein-protein interaction assay using a bacterial two hybrid screen. This analysis may identify possible interactions with the host metabolic machinery or other critical cellular processes. Our results support the hypothesis that bacteriophage MooMoo contains genes whose products are toxic to the host cell. This also represents a general approach for elucidating gene function and may identify potential new targets for therapeutics.

For many years, antibiotic discoveries were found using in vitro testing against pathogens in nutrient rich media. These techniques have been used repeatedly and there is a need for novel techniques to discover new antibiotics. We found that screening for antibiotic in human serum revealed new antibiotic activity. We compared antibiotic activity against benign relatives of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens in nutrient rich media (Mueller-Hinton, MH) and in human serum (HS) based media. In total, more than 100 soil bacteria were isolated from Georgetown College's campus. Isolates were tested for antibiotic activity in both MH and HS media. Lastly, we used 16s rDNA gene sequencing to determine the bacterium that produced antibiotics only in HS. We found that known antibiotics had varied activities in MH vs HS. Four of one hundred soil isolates produced antibiotics in HS but not MH against Acinetobacter. We also found that two of the four did not produce antibiotics when plated on minimal media against Acinetobacter, suggested generally poor nutrient availability was not an explanation for selective activity. Lastly, we identified one antibiotic-producing bacterium as Stenotrophomonas sp. This research demonstrated a physiologically relevant screening technique to help find antibiotics that may remain hidden using standard techniques. Some of the future directions of this project are determining the relationship between HS and antibiotic production: Is the antibiotic a result of bacteria metabolizing with some of the components of the HS? Or is Acinetobacter uniquely susceptible when growing in HS?

Microbacteriophage Hasitha is a virus that infects Microbacterium foliorum, a bacterium associated with grasses that was first discovered in Germany. Hasitha was isolated from an enriched compost sample and is of particular interest due to its unusual growth pattern: it appears to infect and kill stationary (non-replicating) bacterial cells. Most bacteriophages require actively growing host cells to produce new phage progeny. We discovered this unusual characteristic through a fortuitous observation of plates that were allowed to incubate on the bench for approximately a month. During this time, a noticeable “halo” grew around the initial site of infection and consumed most of the lawn. Here we report the genomic sequence of Hasitha and its ultrastructural features. We also report the results of experiments to determine the mechanism for the expanding plaques. Our results suggest that phage particles diffuse outward from the initial site of infection and continue infect and lyse surrounding stationary host cells, forming the characteristic halos. These results have ultimately contributed to expanding knowledge of bacteriophage genomics and host-microbe interactions.

For a virus to infect a host cell it must bind to the cell's surface, fuse with the plasma membrane, and enter the cell. Unlike most viruses that encode a small number of proteins for binding and fusion, vaccinia virus, a member of the poxvirus family, encodes 11 proteins (A16, A21, F9, G3, G9, H2, J5, A28, L1, O3 and L5). These viral proteins form an entry fusion complex on the surface of vaccinia virus [1,2]. The yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system was used to screen direct interactions between those viral proteins. The coding region of each vaccinia protein was fused with either the activation or binding domain of a common transcription factor and transformed into yeast. Interactions between these proteins brought the two domains together. These interactions were detected by the activation of genes that coded for proteins that are required for growth on selective media and produced an enzyme that cleaves X gal, turning the colonies blue. In an initial screen, putative interactions between J3ACT and J3Bind, F9ACT and J3Bind were observed. These need to be confirmed by remaking and rescreening the yeast hybrids as well as confirming that the recombinant vaccina virus protein alone cannot active expression of the reporter gene.

Observations from state-of-the-art facilities have revolutionized our view of the inter-relation between Intracluster Medium (ICM), optical emission-line gas, and the brightest cluster galaxy. However, the details of how the feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) influences the hot atmospheres and triggers the cold gas formation are still not fully understood. In this talk, I will present a statistical study of X-ray cavities in Planck-selected clusters using Chandra observations, with the aim of providing further insight into how AGN feedback operates on clusters. The Planck cluster sample is an all-sky mass-selected, nearly unbiased sample of galaxy clusters at moderate redshift (z<0.35), which could reflect the entire AGN feedback cycle at the centers of galaxy clusters, making it an ideal sample to study this mechanism.

Design and construction of a Modular NaI(Tl) Detector Array for use in the Parity and Time Reversal Violation Measurements for NOPTREX, - The goal of the NOPTREX collaboration is to probe the Standard Model by utilizing the properties of low energy neutron-nucleus resonances to find evidence of parity- and time-reversal-odd violations. In order to conduct these sensitive experiments, it is needed to design and simulate an array of modular, high precision NaI(Tl) detectors. These detectors will be designed to operate in both pulse and current modes. We have tentative beam time at LANSCE to perform a search for new parity violation in heavy nuclei as candidates for time reversal and to perform a research and development effort on the n+d=t+gamma experiment. We will discuss the results of our experiments to determine the most efficient design of the detectors, electronics, and magnetic shielding, as well as our progress on the construction and characterization of the array.

In this presentation, we discuss the collection of chromatographic data for the development of a scent detection and classification algorithm for chemical scents. Scents are classified into families based on commonalities in verbal descriptions. For example, notes of oak and cedar would correspond to a woody scent, while lilies and rose would be floral. In “The Atlas of Odor Character Profiles” (1985), Andrew Dravnieks rates the applicability of verbal scent descriptors for 160 chemicals. The applicability of these descriptors were used to sort the chemicals into their scent families. Three chemicals were selected from each of three families. Gas Chromatography (GC) is used to generate signals of peaks with retention times characteristic of their corresponding chemicals. The height of the peaks corresponds to the concentration of the chemical sample. Using the selected Atlas chemicals, a data bank was created. A machine learning algorithm was created using a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) structure that, when given an input of a GC signal, will output a verbal description of scent. This project is funded by the KY NSF EPSCoR URE program.

It is well known that stars form from the gravitational collapse of cold interstellar gas clouds within galaxies, but how such clouds themselves form remains up for debate. The origins and development of these clouds should therefore be investigated. We are cataloging HISA features observed with radio telescopes and reported in the research literature. Hydrogen I self-absorption (HISA) occurs when a cloud of cold neutral hydrogen atoms absorbs 21cm wavelength radiation emitted by warmer neutral hydrogen gas lying behind it. So far, we have catalogued hundreds of features in dozens of papers from the first two decades of HISA research. We plan to extend this work up to the present day to document the HISA cloud population throughout our home galaxy. The completed HISA database will be made accessible to the scientific community for analysis and follow-up observations. In a sample meta-study, we have compared a pioneering single-dish telescope HISA survey (Knapp 1974) to more recent interferometer surveys of the same clouds with better angular resolution but worse velocity resolution (Gibson et al. 2005; Gibson 2010) to examine the relative biases each has on HISA detections. We are now broadening this work to include more surveys. In addition, we plan to compare the gas properties (temperature, density, etc.) implied by different studies to assess how their analytic assumptions affect our knowledge of these clouds' evolutionary states and their prospects for future star formation.

We present preliminary results of abundance analysis from an optical spectroscopic survey of compact planetary nebulae (PNe) in the Galactic disk. This is an ongoing survey to build a comprehensive database of Galactic compact PN chemical abundances. The optical spectra of 14 PNe were obtained with the 4.1-meter Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope. The elemental abundances for these PN were calculated using the Nebular Empirical Analysis Tool (NEAT). Here we present the oxygen abundance for each PN and compare them to results available in the literature. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant AAG-1616807.

The Duffing Oscillator (DO) is a bistable, nonlinear oscillator initially described by Georg Duffing in 1918. Due to its nonlinear nature, the DO is an excellent system to study stochastic resonance, a phenomenon also occurring in ring lasers, electron paramagnetic resonance and other non-linear systems. Stochastic resonance (SR) is a phenomenon whereby a system experiences resonance due to noise being added to it. Optimal stochastic resonance occurs when the optimal amount of noise is added. In this talk, we present the progress in development of a magnetically driven mechanical model of the DO. The design is inspired by the one proposed in Donoso, Ladera, Eur. J. Phys. 33 (2012), where a high-power rare earth magnet is attached to a spring and placed inside a small copper coil. Potential energy of the system can be described by a fourth order function and is called Duffing potential. The second coil placed underneath of the experimental setup provides an external periodic and white noise forces. The external force magnitude is controlled via the electrical current passing through this coil. Data acquisition and system control is powered by a LabVIEW DAQ system. We show here our experimental setup and procedure as well as the categorization of SR. This project is funded by the KAS Research Grant, project ID # 23270225.

We developed python code to analyze an ensemble of twelve regional climate models (RCMs), to learn about the effects of climate change in Seattle, Washington. The Weather Research Forecast (WRF) Model coupled with the RCMs predicts changes in the intensity and number of heat waves in Seattle for the next eighty years. We define a heat wave to be any day with a temperature within the top 1 percent of the temperature distribution from 1970-2000. Out of 12 RCMs, 10 predict that the highest 1 percent of temperatures will steadily increase at a rate of about 0.0525°C per year. Further, the rate at which the defining temperature of a heatwave increase matches the rate of median temperature increase, indicating an overall warming trend. Future analysis can be tailored to individual fields concerned with heat waves.

Using the PASCO Driven Damped Harmonic Oscillations Experiment EX-5522A apparatus, chaotic motion can be observed and studied. This setup has been researched extensively (see, Robert DeSerio, American Journal of Physics 71, 250 (2003)). The available PASCO apparatus was upgraded using Rotary Motion Sensor CI-6538, which measures angles to a resolution of 0.09 degrees, in order to help us achieve our goal of experimentally observing bifurcations in the system. LabVIEW based code was developed and implemented to control the stepper motor and angle encoder, and to collect and record data. Bifurcations were analyzed to observe a clearer image of the patterns of periodicity and chaos within the system by using obtained experimental data.

KCNE3 is a transmembrane protein involved in modulating the function of several voltage-gated potassium channels. KCNE3 interacts with KCNQ1 and produces KCNE3/KCNQ1 channels that are voltage-independent in the physiological voltage range, which are important for cardiac action potentials and transport of water and salts across epithelial cells. KCNE3 is expressed in the colon, small intestine, specific cell types in the stomach, and all regions of the human heart including left and right ventricles. The dysfunction and mutations of the KCNE3 lead to several diseases including long QT syndrome. The knowledge of the structure of KCNE3 protein in a more naive environment is lacking. This is due to the challenges associated with the sample preparation in lipid bilayers required for biophysical studies. In this study, we have optimized a method of molecular biology approaches to prepare spin-label KCNE3 samples in lipid bilayers for electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements. EPR in combination with site-directed spin labeling (SDSL), can provide structural and dynamic properties of membrane proteins. The continuous wave (CW) EPR power saturation measurements were used to confirm the incorporation of KCNE3 in lipid bilayers. The circular dichroism (CD) data was used to obtain the secondary structure of KCNE3 in lipid bilayers. The CW-EPR lineshape analysis data on several spin-label sites have been further utilized to obtain dynamic information of the protein in lipid bilayers. Our EPR data on KCNE3 are consistent with previous EPR studies of membrane proteins.

The RSpec is a slitless grating spectroscope that comes with its own software for analysis and sells for only $395. It was designed for classroom demonstrations or lab analyses of gas discharge tubes. It can also be used to examine Wien's law using the spectrum of a tungsten light bulb. Creative educators have used the RSpec to examine LED and laser emissions and to perform reflectance and fluorescence spectroscopy. We examined RSpec's capabilites for near infrared and Raman spectroscopy. We find that while the instrument can detect some near infrared, absorption by the glass covering and the grating itself limit its use as an IR tool. Additionally, Raman spectroscopy is not possible because Raman lines tend to be weak and the device is programmed to constantly adjust gain and exposure times so that weaker features cannot be observed. We end by briefly discussing some qualitative applications of the RSpec for advanced lab courses and individual student capstone projects.

Humimic Medical offers six different density grades of medical gel. Gelatin #5 medical gel, density of 898.4 kg/m3 and a Young's Modulus of 1.09 x 105 Pa, is commonly used to simulate blood clots and brain tissue. In this study we exposed this gel to gamma rays using common radioactive sources found in nuclear physics labs and calculate its mass and linear attenuation coefficients. Sources used for this experiment were Cadmium-109, Manganese-54 and Cobalt-60. We will discuss our data collection method using a ST-360 Radiation Counter with a GM-35 probe and compare our calculated coefficient values for each source with the Virtual X-Ray Imaging Library on GPU.

Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) have been identified as promising solid-state devices to recover exhaust waste in internal combustion engines. TEGs convert heat directly into electricity and can be used to downsize the alternator. The addition of new devices to the engine exhaust system, however, lead to an increase the back pressure of the engine and reduce overall engine efficiency. We investigate using a TEG attached directly to the exhaust. By taking temperature data from vehicle exhaust, we determine appropriate semiconductor materials to build an exhaust TEG. We then built a computational model and simulate a designed TEG for our selected materials, geometry, and temperature data. We find an aftermarket TEG is capable of converting waste heat directly into electricity via the Seebeck effect for our model and that with additional followup a prototype should next be constructed.

Bellarmine University (BU) is part of the Kentucky Association for Research with LSST (KARL) consortium and has been a member of the Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC). BU's Tier2 grid supercomputing resource is part of the DESC's dedicated data pipeline to run large-scale PhoSim Rubin (LSST) Simulated Survey #1 data using PhoSim (Photon Simulator). BU's grid supercomputer simulated large batches of PhoSim images chip-by-chip using parallel processing. The PhoSim Simulated Survey #1 data set, available publicly through BU, contains thousands of images at a single location on the sky covering 10 square degrees. This Phosim data set contains number of new capabilities that haven't been studied in a large-scale astronomical simulation, including galaxy morphology. A significant fraction of all dark energy measurement systematics will come from the complex physical effects of the atmosphere, telescope, and camera that distort the light from astronomical objects and these distortions will be imprinted in the LSST images. PhoSim follows the path of individual photons from astronomical sources, tracing each photon generated by the astronomical objects through the atmosphere and generating realistic optical/UV/IR/X-ray images of stars and galaxies. PhoSim provides a robust way of understanding the systematics through high-fidelity image simulations using multi-threaded Monte-Carlo techniques, including FFTs (Fast Fourier Transforms) and fast intercept calculations to determine a comprehensive physical description of the atmosphere and the LSST telescope and camera in order to simulate realistic astronomical images. We have conducted brightness studies of astronomical objects using the simulated Survey #1 data using DS9.

With its excellent flux sensitivity and its moderate angular resolution, the XMM-Newton Observatory is well-suited for detailed spatially-resolved spectroscopic studies of Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs). In particular, observations made by XMM-Newton of SNRs that feature X-ray emission dominated by synchrotron radiation (as produced by accelerated cosmic-ray electrons) are crucial for providing new insights into cosmic-ray acceleration by SNRs to TeV energies and higher. We present an analysis of XMM-Newton observations made of two SNRs of this class (G32.4+01 and G330.2+1.0). Our analysis draws upon new complementary low radio frequency observations of these SNRs and searches for spatial variations in the spectral properties in the detected X-ray emission along the azimuths of these sources. Initial results will be presented and discussed.

With tactile foraging ducks utilizing a bill to locate resources, research into mechanoreception is prevalent. The duck bill skin contains Herbst and Grandry corpuscles, which are multicellular nonneuronal structures, equivalent to Pacinian and Meisner corpuscles in human glabrous skin. As with mammalian corpuscles, in the duck bill sensory neurons interact with these corpuscles detect vibration and pressure. Various species of ducks have different foraging abilities, raising the question of whether this is reflected in the anatomy and/or function of structures that sense touch in the bill. The current study focuses on how densely populated the two types of corpuscles are in duck bills of seven species, to give insight as to whether the corpuscle density and size varies based upon foraging abilities. With results still underway, the goal is to be able to measure the density of corpuscles per/mm2 in the bill skin and average corpuscle diameter, to correlate this with bone morphology and functional responses from trigeminal neurons from these species (Schneider et al., 2019). In addition, previous studies have recently shown that the lamellar cells of Herbst and Grandry corpuscles in late-stage embryos can be excited by mechanical stimulation (Nikolaev et al., 2020). Therefore, in parallel we are investigating the developmental time-course of expression of the force-gated ion channel piezo2 in these cells using in situ hybridization and qPCR. Understanding how these structures relate to tactile sensitivity can provide insight to how human mechanoreception forms and discriminates touch.

The channels for transmitting electrical activity along neurons is similar from squid to humans with sodium currents accounting for the upstroke of an action potential and potassium channels for the rapid and delayed ionic flux for the repolarization. Pharmacological agents tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) block different subsets of voltage gated potassium (K+) channels. The chordotonal organs in crab limbs are a model of proprioceptive sensation and have rapidly- and slowly-adapting sensory neurons. Since 4-AP is used clinically for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Multiple sclerosis (MS) treatments, a better understanding of its action on proprioceptive models can aid in understanding the potential effects in mammalian systems. To assess the action of these blockers on the function of proprioceptive sensory neurons, the neurons were evoked by movements associated with the joint while applying these compounds individually as well as in combination. The evoked compound action potentials in isolated nerves as well as with intact to the sensory endings can be examined. Both 4-AP and TEA decreased activity individually, as well as when combined. Potassium channels are sensitive to both blockers in this marine crustacean model. It appears the action is on electrical induction and conduction within the axons. This crab crustacean proprioceptive model can be used for future intensive investigations, building on the results presented, in the pharmacology of the mechanosensitive channels and neuronal activity.

Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis (red-sided garter snake) is known to exit hibernacula and immediately enter mating season. Once mating season is completed T. sirtalis will migrate to feeding grounds. Research has shown Glucocorticoid (GC) levels are higher during mating season than during migration. GC levels are known to be controlled by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, in which, the first step includes the production of corticotropin-releasing-hormone (CRH). Mating (n=14) and migrating (n=11) T. sirtalis organisms were euthanized, and immunohistochemistry was utilized to stain CRH containing cells in caudal brain sections. Stained CRH cells were counted in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus in T. sirtalis to determine if increased GC levels during mating season is due to increased CRH production by the HPA axis. There was no statistical difference in the number of CRH cells in snakes sampled during mating versus migration. These results suggest that increased GC levels are caused by an as-yet unknown factor. Brain sections were analyzed to determine if CRH cells were found elsewhere, and they were found in the cortex (which is known as the hippocampus in humans). CRH cells are known to function as a releasing hormone, which requires nearness to the pituitary gland. Therefore, since CRH is far too large to be a neurotransmitter, CRH is likely acting as a neuromodulator in the cortex.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes serious lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis and has been designated a serious threat by the CDC due to increasing multi-drug resistance.1 One approach for developing new antibiotics is to target bacterial nutrient acquisition such as inhibiting the production of bacterial siderophores.2 The P. aeruginosa siderophore pyochelin is produced from salicylic acid which is derived from the molecule chorismate.3,4 Salicylate production in P. aeruginosa is catalyzed by isochorismate synthase (PchA) and isochorismate pyruvate lyase (PchB).4 These first steps in pyochelin synthesis are good targets but inhibitor development against PchB is hampered because the mechanism is not fully known. To define the PchB mechanism, isotopically labeled substrate (chorismate) is required. The goal of this project is to reconstitute the shikimate pathway in vitro to produce isotopically labeled chorismate. The first and second half of this pathway were targeted independently to test the feasibility of recombining all the shikimate enzymes in a one-pot. In vitro reconstitution of the first half of the shikimate pathway was tested using an HPLC assay to verify the production of the intermediate shikimic acid. The second half of the pathway was tested using a fluorescence assay utilizing an additional enzyme (Irp9) to convert chorismate to the fluorescent product salicylate. This assay demonstrated that production of chorismate was hampered in the second half of the pathway with the final enzyme chorismate synthase (AroC) as the likely cause of the bottleneck. To address this issue, exploration of using a bifunctional chorismate synthase has been undertaken.

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the universal chemical energy currency of life, is synthesized by a biological macromolecule called ATP synthase. Dysfunction of ATP synthase imbalances cellular energy, resulting in disease and even cell death. Due to its essential function in the cell, ATP synthase has been validated as an antibacterial target. The increase in drug-resistant bacterial infections necessitates the identification of novel drug target sites on microbial ATP synthase. Therefore, we are interested in studying the periplasmic loop of subunit a, here referred to as TM 2-3 loop, in E.coli due to its structural heterogeneity across organisms. To understand the importance of this loop, we deleted the loop which shows the loss of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis activity. To determine the functional role of TM 2-3 loop residues, we genetically modified the residues and studied their functions. Mutating P137 to cysteine exhibited both reduced ATP synthesis and hydrolysis activity, suggesting its importance for ATP synthase activity. This study may help us understand the role of loop residues that may contribute to the selective inhibition of ATP synthase.

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Drug-induced cardiotoxicity is a major reason for market pushbacks of novel heart medication. There is a need for a highly efficient in-vitro system for preclinical cardiotoxicity and drug efficacy that allow for prolonged and functional cardiomyocytes. Prior to the current study, the biomimetic culture system was proven to maintain the functionality and viability of pig heart slices for up to 6 days. However, by day 10, heart slices suffered down-regulation of cardiac genes, upregulation of fibrotic remodeling genes, and inflammatory responses. To optimize this system, various drugs were screened and concluded that Triiodothyronine (T3) and Dexamethasone (Dex) are the best treatments to increase contractility and functionality of the heart slices. In addition, physiological electromechanical stimulation was utilized to improve in-vitro culture system. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) does not show hypertrophy with mechanical laod in day 0 (D0) and day 12 (D12) conditions. Immunofluorescence staining (IF) showed both stimulated and unstimulated systems maintained connexin 43 for 12 days compared with control. Lastly, Trichrome staining does not show a significant amount of fibrosis difference between D0 and electromechanical treatment. It was concluded that the combination of mechanical stimulation and T3-Dex treatment prolonged the functionality and viability of pig heart slices for 12 days.

The meninges surrounding the brain have long been thought of as simply a protective layer beneath the skull, but in recent years research has shown that they are responsible for many other functions, such as regulating cortical development and contributing to inflammation in various pathological conditions. Meningeal cells have also been shown to be phagocytic, capable of engulfing β-amyloid (the accumulation of which causes Alzheimer's Disease) and bacteria that cause meningitis. Previously our laboratory demonstrated that meningeal cells express the phagocytic receptor Jedi-1 (also known as PEAR1 or MEGF12), which is known to contribute to the clearance of apoptotic neurons in the developing Dorsal Root Ganglia (DRG). Using an in vitro engulfment assay, we have demonstrated that Jedi-1 in meningeal cells is necessary for their phagocytic ability. Jedi-1-expressing meningeal cells were more efficient than cells without Jedi-1 expression at phagocytizing beads, which mimic apoptosis cells. However, despite efforts, we have not been able to identify the exact cell(s) that express Jedi-1. Current efforts are aimed at understanding the role of Jedi-1 in meningeal cells in vivo with potential therapeutic implications for diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease.

Swallowing must be coordinated with breathing to prevent aspiration, but the mechanisms of this coordination are poorly understood. In the sagittally sectioned rodent hindbrain (SSRH) preparation, control networks for swallow are exposed at the dorsomedial edge of the preparation. In vitro swallow is defined as a burst at the hypoglossal nerve (XIIn) unaccompanied by phrenic (C4) motor output. Here we used transgenic mice in which the genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator GCaMP6F was expressed in the germline, enabling optical recording from all cells exposed at or near the sagittal surface of the SSRH. At the end of each experiment, the tissue was fixed, and a 400 µm section was cut from the sagittal face, for immunohistochemical processing to identify ChAT+, phox2b+, and SST+ neurons. Using this preparation, we identified a novel population of neurons rostral to the pre-Bötzinger complex (PBC) and dorsal to nucleus ambiguus (NA) that is immediately activated following stimuli. Seconds after stimulus offset, a discrete population of neurons in NA become active, and their activity is accompanied by a burst on XIIn unaccompanied by C4 activity, occurring immediately before or just after the inspiratory burst, consistent with adaptive intercalation of breath and swallow. Unlike the diffuse activity seen along the ventral respiratory column during fictive respiration, networks activated during swallow are spatially compact with sharp, well-defined borders, consistent with modularity. This functional anatomical organization is supported by immunohistochemistry: strong phox2b and ChAT expression with sharp boundaries was found to overlap with the population of neurons strongly activated during stimulation, and the delayed activity associated with fictive swallow overlapped precisely with the welldefined ChAT- and phox2b-positive populations within NA. These findings highlight divergent strategies between the swallow and respiratory pattern generators, and lay the groundwork for a detailed investigation of adaptive central coordination of swallow with breathing.

Pathogenic bacteria such as Yersinia pestis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis utilize the menaquinone, siderophore, and tryptophan (MST) family of enzymes to produce necessary metabolites1. Therefore, MST enzymes are promising protein targets for new antibiotics based on transition state inhibitors. MST enzymes from Y. pestis and M. tuberculosis convert chorismate to salicylate in the first step of siderophore production by performing both isomerase and lyase functions, however, the mechanism for lyase activity remains unresolved and must be clarified for the development of transition state inhibitors2,3. To help elucidate the lyase mechanism, isotopically labelled chorismate is needed for kinetic isotope effect experiments. An alternative approach to synthesis is to produce labelled chorismate through in vitro reconstitution of the shikimate pathway which converts erythrose-4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to chorismate. To incorporate the deuterium into chorismate, the PEP must be labelled. Deuterating the PEP involves reacting readily available isotopically labelled pyruvate with two bacterial enzymes: pyruvate carboxylase (PycA) and PEP carboxykinase (PckA). The goal of this project is to express and purify PycA and PckA to react in a one-pot reaction with pyruvate and cofactors. Plasmid vectors for PycA and PckA were obtained and ideal expression conditions were determined. Once functional purified protein is obtained, labelled PEP can be produced and incorporated into the shikimate pathway for the synthesis of labelled chorismate to be utilized in experimentation with the MST enzymes.

Protein function is not only encoded by their structure but also their motions. The precise relationship between dynamics and function, however, remain poorly understood. For enzymes, dynamics can play a role in several steps, including substrate recognition. An understanding of dynamics along a reaction coordinate is critical in painting a complete picture of enzyme function and can aid in the design of more efficient enzymes or development of inhibitors.

This work focuses on hGMPK, an enzyme essential for maintaining cellular GTP and for activation of several anti-viral prodrugs. Our group determined the first and only structure of hGMPK so far and also demonstrated its potential as a cancer target. Here, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used to examine dynamics of hGMPK. Backbone chemical shift assignment was facilitated using the following NMR spectra: 2D [1H,15N]-HSQC, 3D HNCA, and 3D H(CCO)NH. 15N-CEST was used to extract longitudinal (R1) and transverse (R2) relaxation parameters. Model-free analysis of R1 and R2 along with {1H}-15N NOE allowed for estimation of order parameters. Experiments were done at 298 K at 14.1 T in the presence and absence of phosphate and substrate, GMP. High-power CPMG relaxation dispersion was used to detect chemical exchange in the millisecond-microsecond timescale.

Preliminary results indicate that fast motions are modulated by substrate binding. Furthermore, apo hGMPK exhibits conformational exchange. Future work will further examine these dynamics and the relationship between the different timescales as well as effects of substrates to determine how these dynamics modulate hGMPK function.

Post-transcriptional tRNA modifications are required for efficient protein translation. Proteins involved in forming tRNA modifications are being studied to understand their role and function. In yeast, the Trm7 methyltransferase forms a complex with Trm732 to modify tRNA at position 32. In humans, lack of Trm7 causes intellectual disability. Little is known about the function of Trm732, although we have shown that one conserved motif in Trm732 is important for tRNA modification. We are identifying other residues important for function using two strategies. First, we compare Trm732 proteins of different organisms using protein alignments to determine conserved regions to mutate for testing. Second, we are expressing randomly mutated Trm732 variants in a sick strain that lacks Trm732. Lack of rescue of strain indicates that the mutation present is harmful to protein function. DNA from these colonies is extracted and sequenced to determine the mutation that causes loss of Trm732 function.

ATP synthase is a multi-subunit protein complex that synthesizes ATP, the universal biological energy carrier. Due to its critical functions in the cell and marked structural differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic forms, ATP synthase is a promising antibacterial target. Recent cryoelectron microscopy models have revealed the overall architecture of bacterial ATP synthase; however, the key interactions between the subunits of ATP synthase are not known. Previous studies have proposed that the periplasmic loop of subunit a, here referred as TM 2-3 loop, interacts with membrane-embedded subunit b of ATP synthase. Here, we report ATP synthesis and hydrolysis studies of TM 2-3 loop residues to probe the sequence's functional significance. The complete deletion of the loop abolished ATP synthase activity. Similarly, the G135C mutation also eliminated enzyme activity, whereas the L136C mutation was defective in ATP synthesis activity only. These studies provide insight into the role of TM 2-3 loop residues and their contribution to key interactions between subunit a and b that may inform future antibacterial drug development.

One cancer causing mechanism is the accumulation of apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites within DNA. AP sites, also known as abasic DNA, result in the loss of a nucleobase, and are known to be caused by environmental and cancer therapeutic genotoxins. In particular, the loss of a nucleobase is caused by hydrolysis of the N-glycosyl bond, leaving an aldehyde functional group in the DNA structure. Current detection methods of AP sites require the use of expensive equipment such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or the use of biotinylated probes like aldehyde-reactive probe (ARP) with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Herein, describes a novel colorimetric method used to quantify AP sites in DNA that is inexpensive and easy to interpret. This assay utilizes bicinchoninic acid (BCA) to quantify AP sites through two methods of measurement: the traditional method measuring absorbances at 562 nm and recording color values (e.g., green value) of the assay using hand-held cameras. This colorimetric assay was implemented within the undergraduate organic chemistry laboratory. Students used Beer's law to generate calibration curves of known samples containing abasic DNA for both methods. Students used the calibration curves and the linear equations to predict unknown abasic DNA concentrations with up to 90% accuracy and compared both methods. This novel colorimetric assay was shown to be easily implemented into the educational laboratory environment.

Time-telling using analog clocks is a topic included in the Elementary Mathematics curriculum standards of the Kentucky Department of Education. However, recent media reports and previous studies have indicated that an everincreasing proportion of young people struggle to correctly read clocks. Although the personal and academic consequences of not mastering this skill are unknown, it is important to document the extent of this issue at a college level. The purpose of this study is to expand on previous research at Morehead State University (MSU) and document college students' understanding of correctly reading analog clocks within the context of a timed task. It is hypothesized that the pressure to demonstrate time-telling proficiency in this context will trigger potential misconceptions that may not be observed in a paper quiz with an unlimited response time. In this phase of the study, the participants will complete an anonymous 5-minute demographics survey that will collect information about the independent variables of the study, like gender, age, race/ethnicity, GPA, MSU College of origin, sports participation, and whether they wear a wristwatch and have an analog clock at home. In addition, they will complete an internet-based, time-restricted quiz on time-telling, where participants have 120 seconds to move a clock's hands to show specific times. The data collection is ongoing in the Fall 2021 semester.

Mathematics is a common barrier to success for students interested in STEM fields, particularly for students from Persons Excluded due to Ethnicity or Race (PEERs). The STEM Ready program at Northern Kentucky University (NKU) seeks to improve mathematics preparation and retention of students interested in STEM. A focus of the program is to test the impact of a two-week bridge program in which students strengthen mathematics skills using the adaptive online program ALEKS, complete guided STEM research projects, and review study skills from a growth mindset perspective. Preliminary data suggest participants benefit from the program. The summer 2020 cohort of participants (N=22, ∼50% PEERs, first-generation, and low-income) completed an online version of the program. While their Math ACT scores (22.2 mean, 23 median) were lower than other first-year STEM majors (24.6 mean, 25 median), cumulative GPA and grades in their first math course were equivalent. The percentage of participants retained in their declared STEM major was equivalent to other first-year STEM majors, and retention at NKU into spring semester was slightly higher (91% vs 77%). The 2021 cohort of participants (N=14, 71.4% PEERs, first-generation, and low-income) completed a residential version of the program. After the summer program, 32% of 2020 participants and 64% of 2021 participants were able to enroll in a higher mathematics course

Herbal supplements are products made with plants, herbs, or botanical substances that are thought to be useful in treating a disease or staying healthy. These products have not been evaluated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease or condition. Despite a lack of scientific evidence of their effectiveness, these products are heavily marketed and are readily available in pharmacies, retail stores, and online. Discovering how college students, particularly those from rural and low socioeconomic settings, learn about herbal supplements and use them has been recognized by the National Institute of Health and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health as a high-priority area of research. The purpose of this study is to better understand how college students in Eastern Kentucky become aware of herbal supplements and the decision-making process leading them to use or not use these supplements, particularly in the context of their attitudes toward science. It is hypothesized that college students may have misconceptions regarding the effectiveness of certain herbal supplements, which may put their health at risk. Understanding this decision-making process helps identify ways to educate the public about how scientific processes apply in the context of medication testing, the limited scientific evidence associated with some herbal supplements, their potential for medication interactions, and cost-efficiency. This study will use a survey-based approach for data collection; this process is ongoing in the Fall 2021 semester.

Physics experiments using smartphones are becoming commonplace because most are equipped with advanced sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetic field sensors. Some advantages of conducting experiments with a smartphone include the ability to do experiments remotely and reducing the cost of purchasing lab equipment. However, there are some disadvantages: iPhones and Androids do not come with the same sensors and some experiments are tricky to perform which leads to results that are inaccurate. Our research project is an examination of smartphone experiments that can be conducted by high school physics and physical science students. Our goal was to identify a collection of experiments, drawn mainly from “The Physics Teacher” journal, that met the following criteria: (1) a percent difference (between theoretical and experimental values) of less than 25%, (2) accessibility to both Android and iPhone users, and (3) addresses a high school physics and/or AP Physics standard. As a first step, we generated a list of standards from the Next Generation Science Standards and AP Physics websites. We selected standards that would be difficult to visualize in the classroom and then looked for smartphone experiments that illustrated the standard. We tested ten smartphone experiments for the following standards: geometric and physical optics, conservation of momentum, electric currents producing magnetic fields, the properties of waves, gravity, conservation of energy, and the Second Law of Thermodynamics. We were able to identify eight experiments that were easy to perform and can be completed successfully with percent difference below 15%.

The STEM Ready program at Northern Kentucky University (NKU) seeks to improve mathematics preparation and retention of students interested in STEM. Inspired by literature about applying concepts to real-world problems and the successes of NKU's UR-STEM program – which provides research opportunities to at-risk students in the summer after their first year at NKU – STEM Ready participants completed three guided research projects during a two-week summer bridge program. The biology, chemistry, and data science research projects were designed by faculty to (1) highlight connections between mathematics and other STEM fields; (2) be accessible to incoming STEM students with various levels of mathematical preparation; (2) be open-ended; (3) be completable in a short timeframe; (4) be well-suited for both in-person and online environments; and (5) be scalable to implement with larger cohorts of students. This talk discusses challenges overcome by faculty while designing these activities.

STEM graduates are essential for a large number of professions and have been identified by the U.S. Department of Defense as essential for an evolving U.S. national security environment. Previous studies on STEM attrition at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) have found that 36.4% of the freshmen cadets interested in STEM graduated with a nonSTEM major. The purpose of this study was to reveal factors associated with STEM attrition and persistence at USAFA. Data corresponding to academic years 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 were provided by the Registrar's Office. Variables of interest included gender, race, majors and minors, attendance to Preparatory school, Scholar status, GPA, and SAT scores. The dependent variable, major change, was classified as Arrivers, Departers, Persisters, and Undecided. The researchers found that cadets who attended Prep School, who were not classified as Scholars, who had a low GPA, and who had a low SAT-M or low SAT-RW score were more likely to switch out of STEM. Cadets classified as Scholars and those with high GPA and SAT-RW scores were more likely to switch into STEM. It was recommended for USAFA to develop an automated system using Registrar data to monitor freshmen cadets and immediately identify cadets at-risk of becoming STEM Departers.

The topic of electric circuits is foundational in electrical engineering. In the electrical engineering program at Western Kentucky University, a seven-hour Circuits course sequence, emphasizing more on circuit analysis (and little on circuit design), is required for majors in the program. A three-hour Digital course, without a lab, is also required. Hence, there is an opportunity to enhance circuit design and implementations. In order to provide electrical engineering students with more circuit design experience after taking these courses, changes to the program's junior design course have been made. Until very recently, team projects from various areas of electrical engineering have been assigned in this course; however, it was decided that team projects emphasizing circuit design would be assigned moving forward. In the most recent course offering, the circuits projects were chosen such that students were required to explore more advanced topics. Working in teams of three or four, they were tasked with designing the circuits from first principles, then simulating the designs using software. During the final weeks of class, each student individually breadboarded their team's circuit design. These changes to the design course provided the students with more real design experience in an essential and foundational program topic and reinforced their simulation, breadboarding, testing, and validation skills. Additional benefits to the curriculum are also expected and will be discussed.

This poster explores an innovative teaching collaboration in which a biology professor and a religion professor linked two undergraduate courses. Students were co-enrolled in Religion & Science (Dr. Browning) and The Nature of Science (Dr. French), both discussion-based courses. Each instructor taught their course and was embedded in the other's. Students participated in a variety of high-impact, non-cognitive teaching practices, including leading discussions and doing experiential learning activities, all intentionally planned and executed to allow exploration of connections between science and religion and articulation of personal worldviews. After many discussions with colleagues, we have determined the importance of practically sharing our experience on a wider stage. This poster highlights the students' and instructors' experiences and outlines an initial set of resources to assist K-12 science teachers in understanding the connections between religion and science in order to increase their comfort level in addressing this topic with their own students.

Service dogs are becoming a prevalent alternative to traditional therapy approaches (Trammel, 2019). In higher education settings where reported stress and anxiety are relatively higher, the use of dogs has been shown to help with students' moods (Trammel, 2019; Bolton & Bhurga, 2021). The current study aimed to measure the difference of effects between interacting with dogs either in experiential format (in-person) or virtual format (watching a video). It also aimed to measure the impacts of human-dog interactions on openness and happiness, and attitudes toward dogs. Participants were recruited from EKU's psychology subject pool. We conducted this study in a controlled environment, and the dog that we had used was the same for all participants. To prevent attrition effects, participants only went through one session. To prevent fatigue with the single dog used in the study, we ensured adequate breaks were taken between sessions and limited sessions to four a day. This was equivalent to a regular daily training session as prescribed by the American Kennel Club. Participants were given surveys before and following interactions that sought to measure openness and happiness before and after interactions. We found that interacting with a dog did affect openness as well as happiness and receptivity to dogs. We also found a difference between experiential and virtual interactions.

Syringe exchange programs (SEP), although still controversial, have been operating in the United States since the 1980's. Under the mantra of “We can't stop them from doing it, but we can make it safer,” SEP distribute a range of needles, syringes, and other paraphernalia. But what are the most common items requested from SEP? Using a data set from an SEP that has been operating for four years, we determined what items are most commonly requested. Not surprisingly, needles were the most requested item, but other items related to health and safety, like alcohol swabs, sterile water, and band-aids, were also very commonly requested. Our findings serve two purposes. First, for a newly established SEP, our data can be used to determine a stock list so that the correct relative amounts of supplies can be obtained. Second, the fact that the majority of clients at SEP are requesting benign safety and health products suggests that users find value in having these items and are likely using them. Within this population, any movement towards health and safety has to be deemed as a good thing.

In the media, video games are often portrayed in a negative way, but research has demonstrated empirical evidence to highlight the positivity video games can have on cognition. This is shown in our study where participants completed game training via immersive virtual reality (VR) through a head-mounted display. The goal was to measure the affects that gaming has on cognition. To begin, 24 healthy participants were randomly assigned to either a non-intervention control or VR group (n=12). Before the intervention, a baseline evaluation was completed using a tablet based neurocognitive assessment. Over the course of 3-weeks participants completed 8-hours (3, 1-hour session/week) of game training. Twenty-hours hours following the final training session, participants completed a post-intervention evaluation using the same assessments used during baseline. Comparing the baseline and post-intervention assessment performances revealed significant improvements in memory, attention and processing speed in participants that completed VR training (p<.05). However, participants in the control condition demonstrated a significant improvement in processing speed, suggesting there is a practice effect for this measure. Therefore, the processing outcomes should be interpreted with caution. In the future, an optimal training duration should be explored to optimize outcomes.

One major gap in the social buffering literature is examining whether siblings can buffer the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis from acute stress. While some research has investigated siblings as potential buffers of stress (Gass et al., 2007; Milevsky & Levitt, 2005), the majority of these investigations lack physiological measures and laboratory experiments inducing acute stress. The goal of this study is to examine whether the support of a sibling buffers the physiological response to a social evaluative stressor in children and adolescents.

For this study, 80 children (9-10 years) and 80 adolescents (15-16 years) will be recruited along with their sibling who are the same age or up to 3 years older and their parents (480 participants in total). Participants will complete the Trier Social Stress Test-Online (TSST-OL; Gunnar et al., 2020) after being randomly assigned to receive support during the speech preparation stage from either a stranger or a sibling. Participants will provide 7 saliva samples before and after the TSST-OL to assess levels of cortisol, which is a physiological mediator of stress, to assess baseline, reactivity, and recovery levels. We will analyze the differences between participants based on condition (stranger vs. sibling), siblings' relationships quality, age and gender.

The poster will demonstrate the details of the ongoing study and any preliminary data collected at the time of conference. The findings from this study will increase our understanding about social buffering in sibling relationships, which will inform intervention strategies aimed at promoting healthy development.

Children's attachment with their caretakers is critical to their socioemotional adjustment, and parenting quality has been consistently demonstrated as a key predictor of attachment (Fraley & Hudson, 2017). Sensitivity is defined as the parents' ability to comprehend and react synchronously to their child's emotional needs (Ainsworth et al, 1778). Covert hostility is a form of parental insensitivity in which the caretaker subtly rejects the child's emotional needs (Biringen, 2008). The present study examines the relationship between these parenting behaviors during a frustration task and children's attachment. As part of a larger longitudinal study, the participants were 35 parent-child dyads (mean child age 6 years). Pairs were left alone with a transparent prize bag, which parents were instructed to not give their children for seven minutes. The task was recorded, then subsequently rated for sensitive and covertly hostile behavior every 15 seconds. Coding was based on guidelines from the Emotional Availability Scale (Biringen, 2000). Child attachment was determined via the Strange Situation, a 25 minute series of separations and reunions (Ainsworth et al, 1978), coded using Crittenden's (2004) classification procedures. Preliminary analyses suggest our hypotheses about connections between these two parenting behaviors and children's attachment are not supported, which may be due to small sample sizes and restriction of range problems. Specifically, parents showed very low rates of sensitive behavior in the frustration task.

According to the Center Disease Control, about 14.4% of the adult U.S. Hispanic population experience anxiety symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been utilized as an effective intervention for reducing symptoms of anxiety. CBT, however, has not been as widely researched among Latino and Hispanic samples. This meta-analysis examined the effectiveness of CBT in reducing anxiety symptoms among predominantly Hispanic samples. We located 13 studies that met criteria for inclusion. Our analysis revealed a strong relationship between CBT and anxiety symptoms among Hispanic clients (d=0.96). In comparison to predominantly White sample (d=0.39), our study suggests that CBT is approximately twice as effective in treating anxiety symptoms for Hispanic population as the White population.

Roughly 800,000 people globally die each year to suicide. Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) is a common therapy that is used to help individuals with suicidal thoughts/ideations. Additionally, this type of therapy is used to give a sense of coaching from the provider to help the clients apply the skills they have learned to real world situations. With this being the case, we are interested in finding out how effective DBT is in treating suicidality. Using psych info, we searched for terms “Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, effectiveness in treating suicidal thoughts, suicidal ideations in individuals, “and we located 13 studies that answered our research question. Our findings show a strong effect (d=.83) of DBT on treating suicidality; DBT is an effective treatment. Based on our findings that have shown a strong effect size, we recommend that DBT be used as a form of psychotherapeutic treatment used specifically for suicidality.

An often overlooked aspect of the multi-cultural classroom is the interaction between Native-English-speaking (NES) students and Non-native English Speaking (NNES) instructors. This type of interaction often results in lower course evaluations for NNES instructors due to students' negative perception of NNES accents (Subtirelu, 2015). According to 94% of samples in a meta-analysis of research on contact hypothesis (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006), contact and prejudice between groups are inversely related. Contact via electronic means has also been shown to be sufficient in reducing anxiety between members of majority groups toward minority groups (White et al., 2019). This study seeks to examine the contact hypothesis in a distance learning situation. Participants were randomly assigned to four lecture groups instructed by an NES instructor or an NNES instructor. Participants in two of the four groups watched a short self-introduction video recorded by the instructor before the lessons and the subsequent recall questions began. At the end of the lessons and the related recall questions, participants completed a motivation scale survey. Preliminary findings indicate that instructor introduction influenced students' motivation and effort. Findings from the current study have implications for future online course design.

About 30% of all Vietnam War veterans have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Service animal interventions have grown in popularity and are being acknowledged as an effective therapeutic treatment for returning veterans. But how effective are service animal interventions for veteran's quality of life? This meta-analysis used articles from PsycInfo, Google Scholar, and Academic Search Ultimate while searching for key terms “Service animal, animal-assisted therapy, quality of life, and veterans.” We located 13 studies that included interventions that answered our research question. Our analyses revealed a strong relationship with trauma (d=0.86), anxiety (d=0.93), and quality of life (d=0.68) as well as a moderate relationship with depression (d=0.50) and happiness (d=0.50). Our findings also suggest that equine services have a stronger relationship with trauma (d=1.10), while service dogs have a greater effect on quality of life (d=1.75). Our findings suggest a strong relationship between service animal interventions and quality of life. We recommend that the Veteran's Administration place greater emphasis on reintegration measures utilizing animals for returning veterans. First, the VA needs to invest more money and time into research for and training service animals. Second, more research needs to be conducted in order to distinguish between which animals are more effective in treating different aspects of everyday life.

Parental sensitivity is the key determinant of attachment security and child well-being. Sensitivity has also been shown to mediate the relationship between parenting risk and children's symptoms (van der Voort et al., 2014; Zhang et al, 2020). Sensitivity is defined as parental behavior that is attuned to children's emotional needs. In the present study, we hypothesize that parents' sensitivity will be related to children's self-report and parent-report of symptoms. As part of a larger longitudinal study of Eastern Kentucky families, 33 children (mean age 4.5 years) and their parents participated in the Strange Situation (Ainsworth, Blehar, & Waters, 1978). This separation-reunion procedure places both parent and child under some stress, and the Toddler Care Index 15-point synchrony scale (Crittenden, 2007) was utilized to rate sensitivity. Children were interviewed about their internalizing (e.g., anxious, depressed) and externalizing (e.g., oppositional) behaviors, using a puppet interview developed for the study. Parents also completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL: Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001), which also assesses internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Preliminary results reveal support for our hypothesis. Parents who displayed greater sensitivity in the Strange Situation tended to have children reporting lower levels of internalizing symptoms, as well as parents reporting lower levels of child externalizing symptoms. Of particular note, many of our parents received low sensitivity scores and these findings suggest such intervention might help both these parents and their children.

Depressed parents have been shown to have children with increased emotional and behavioral difficulties (Hagal & Paley, 2020). The rationale for such findings is that parenting is affected by depression. We examined two parenting constructs (reflective functioning and emotion coaching) that have been associated with parental depression, but they have not apparently been studied jointly. Parental reflective functioning (RF) is the ability to understand children's behavior in terms of underlying mental states (Slade et al., 2005), and depressed mothers have demonstrated lower RF relative to non-depressed mothers. Gottman, Fainsilber, & Katz (1997) described parents as emotion coaching if they treated the child's feelings as important and a teaching opportunity. The opposite of coaching is dismissing/disapproving. We hypothesized that higher parents' depression scores would be associated with lower reflective functioning skills and higher emotion dismissing. The present study involved 21 families from Eastern Kentucky who participated in a larger longitudinal study. Children averaged 16.6 years at the time this data was collected. Parents were interviewed about their child's internal states during two tasks, and their responses were rated for RF on a 7-point scale. They were also interviewed about their teen's sadness and anger, which was rated on a 10 point scale, where 10 indicated highly disapproving responses to their child's feelings. Parental depression was assessed through a self-report measure, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D: Radloff, 1977). Preliminary analyses suggest our hypotheses were not supported, which may be due to small sample size and non-normally distributed data.

Many states (Kentucky included) are in the process of passing bills that will criminalize the teaching of critical race theory in classrooms from the elementary to doctorate level. Within critical race theory lies the teaching of cultural competence. These laws could have drastic effects on the efficacy of helping professionals in those states. To explore the significance of cultural competency among mental health professionals' treatment outcomes, this researcher conducted a meta-analysis with PsycINFO. Nine studies were found that met search criteria. Among these nine studies, many different cultural backgrounds represented. These backgrounds included Asian Americans, African Americans, Latino/a Americans, and members of the Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual (LGB) community. The total number of participants included in this meta-analysis was 2,265. The researcher found the overall effect size of this meta-analysis to be 2.13, indicating a large effect between clinicians' cultural competency and client treatment outcomes. These results indicate that cultural competency plays a vital role in therapy for diverse clients. If these bills are passed, diverse populations could face a drastic decrease in the quality of their mental health care.

It has been previously shown that non-native English speaking (NNES) instructors have been rated lower within course evaluations and are typically criticized for their accents (Rubin, 1992; Subtirelu, 2015). Reasonings behind this have not been researched much, though the relevance of this topic is continuing to grow through online learning. The current study aims to determine if the presence of a NNES accents brings about more anxiety whilst learning new material compared to an instructor with a standard American accent. Participants were given a set of four videos divided into two segments: one containing videos with a NNES and the other containing videos with a standard American accented speaker. After each video, participants were asked recall questions over the information that they had just received before moving on the next video. In between the two segments, participants were given an anxiety scale to measure the amount of anxiety they felt whilst listening to the two videos. At the end of the study, participants were asked to fill out a Chinese language experience form and demographic information. Our finding indicated the instructor voice influenced recall and anxiety. Findings from the current study have implications for distance education and pedagogical practices.

Approximately 1 in 54 children (or 2%) in the United States is diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although early intervention is the gold standard for this helping this population, how positive are the behavioral outcomes from these early intervention programs? Using PsycInfo, we searched for terms “communication, social skills, and adaptability,” and we located 14 studies that included data that answered our research question. Our analysis showed moderate to strong effect sizes between early intervention for children with an autism spectrum disorder regarding communicative skills (Cohen's d = 0.73), social skills (d = 0.63), and adaptability (d = 0.77). We recommend that early intervention continues to be standard practice for this community as its benefits have been empirically documented. Additionally, we recommend a higher amount of advocacy and psychoeducation be available for parents of children with ASD so they can develop to their fullest potential. Lastly, we recommend that early screening for ASD become more widely available so early intervention can easily implemented earlier in development.

Objectives: Jail and prison studies report that 46% of inmates have a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), compared to 8.5% of the general population1. This study addresses the question of whether TBI affects substance use and recidivism rates in inmates.

Methods: Using PsycInfo, studies were located using the search terms “traumatic brain injury or TB and recidivism.” Ten studies were collected in which the relationships between TBI, substance abuse, and recidivism were measured and reported. This study aggregated data from studies collected over the last 23 years and applied meta-analytical techniques to evaluate the overall relationship between TBI and substance use and recidivism.

Findings: This study found moderate relationships between TBI and substance use (OR = 2.12) and TBI and recidivism (OR = 1.96). These relationships may be moderated by other potential variables, such as trauma, mental illness, or antisocial personality characteristics.

Conclusions: This study demonstrates that TBI impacts both substance use and recidivism rates in inmates, which can hold far reaching implications for treatment efforts in correctional settings. Research in this area may inform future neuropsychological treatment methods within correctional facilities to address TBI in addition to other forensic concerns.

One in six individuals experience four or more types of adverse childhood experiences, commonly known as “ACEs” (2019). At least five of the top ten leading causes of death were associated with ACEs, including death by suicide. How strongly are ACEs related to suicidal ideation, having a suicide plan, attempting suicide, and multiple suicide attempts? A meta-analysis was conducted using PsycInfo. We searched for articles using the terms “adverse childhood experiences,” “ACEs,” “suicide,” “suicidality,” etc. and found 7 studies that included data relevant to our research question. Our analyses revealed that a strong relationship exists between ACEs and suicidal thoughts/ideation (OR=4.08), suicide plans (OR=11.75), attempting suicide once (OR=9.71), and having multiple suicide attempts (OR=4.46). The results of this meta-analysis will be important for any health practitioner to consider when treating individuals who have experienced ACEs. Being aware of this strong relationship will help providers recognize individuals who may be predisposed to suicidality due to the ACEs they encountered early in life.

In the United States, it is estimated that someone is sexually assaulted every 68 seconds (RAINN, 2021). Such a prevalent issue demands attention to the efficacy of treating survivors. In this meta-analysis, the effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and behavioral issues resulting from sexual assault is examined. Employing PsycInfo and searching for terms such as, “sexual abuse, sexual assault, CBT effectiveness, Cognitive behavioral treatment, PTSD, and behavioral problems,” 18 applicable studies were found. The overall finding of this analysis showed an effect size of d = 1.05 for the effectiveness of CBT. Four moderator variables were tested. These moderators and their respective effect sizes are trauma (d = 0.61), mood (d = 1.58), behavioral problems (d = 0.88), and sexual behaviors (d = 1.62). These effect sizes show that CBT has a very strong effect in treating PTSD and behavioral issues resulting from sexual assault. The results of this meta- analysis are important for aiding in the establishment of a more consistent and effective treatment plan when working with sexual assault survivors.

More than 1 in 3 women and nearly 1 in 4 men have experienced sexual violence involving physical contact during their lifetime.Therefore it is no surprise that intervention programs are being developed to fight the ongoing threat of sexual misconduct, particularly among college students. In this study, a meta-analysis is conducted to determine the relationship between the presence of Bystander Intervention Programs and respectful attitudes and behaviors surrounding sexual misconduct; 17 studies were retained on the basis of answering the research question. Sources were found using PsychInfo and Google Scholar and search terms included “sexual misconduct”, “sexual assault”, “sexual harassment”, “prevention”, and “bystander programs”. Findings showed significant beneficial outcomes postintervention especially in bystander efficacy and bystander intention to help. The results of the analysis indicate that Bystander Programs are an effective resource for improving attitudes and behaviors surrounding sexual misconduct and should be considered useful in fighting the threat of sexual violence.

The World Health Organization (2017) estimates that approximately 264 million adults around the globe have anxiety. Anxiety can have a strong effect on our day-to-day functioning. One of the most important functions is sleeping; it affects everything from our cognitive and creative abilities to our perceptions of well-being and health. How strongly are anxiety and sleep quality related? A meta-analysis was conducted using the PsycINFO, Academic Search Ultimate, and CINAHL Complete databases. I searched for the terms ‘anxiety disorders or anxiety or generalized anxiety disorder’ and ‘sleep.’ I located 20 empirical studies that presented correlations for the relationship between anxiety and 1) sleep quality or 2) total sleep time. The weighted average correlation for anxiety and sleep quality was r = -.30 (as anxiety went up, sleep quality went down) and for anxiety and total sleep time was r = -.37. Correlations around r = .30 are generally considered moderately sized, so we can conclude that anxiety has a moderate effect on sleep. These results imply that if we can help people reduce their anxiety, it will improve their sleep, which will then have other indirect positive effects on their lives.

The National Coffee Association estimates that over 60% of Americans drink coffee every day. Many people do this because they believe that there are major neurological improvements. Reaction time is one aspect of caffeine's neurological effects that is easy to capture experimentally. To analyze whether caffeine contributed substantially to simple reaction time (SRT), we conducted a meta-analysis utilizing data from 14 relevant studies (mean sample size N = 62). Using the PsycInfo, Medline, and CINAHL databases, we searched for terms “Caffeine”, “reaction time”, “SRT”, and “coffee consumption.” Each study that was included used a pre-post experimental design. Participants' SRT were measured before and after they had been given a dose of caffeine. The weighted average effect size of caffeine on SRT was small, r = .18. There were no obvious moderating variables shared between any of the studies. This is a remarkably small effect given the known stimulant characteristics of caffeine, and it indicates only a low level of cognitive and motor enhancement follow caffeine consumption.

My research evaluated the shift in the “self” through secondary socialization and symbolic interactions. The interactions need not involve another person but can be with designed nonhuman characters, even with a brief exchange. The research subjects took a test of moral choices (DIT-2) before and after playing a video game. The subjects played the game for 1 hour a day, three times a week, for three weeks with a DIT-2 survey at the beginning of the study and after a 1-week break at the end. A small survey of uniquely designed questions of moral choices was given before and after each gameplay. Three of the subjects were selected for interviews. An analysis of the responses to the DIT-2 showed a change in the subjects' moral choices between the two surveys. A T-Test indicated a statistical significance in the DIT-2 surveys. The small surveys showed no statistical significance with a T-Test. The interviews due to the game played gave only two answers to the choices made by the subject. Because of this, the interviews gave no relevant information. The results indicate that a change to the “self” occurs in the person playing virtual video games through symbolic interactions with virtual stimuli. Arguments over virtual games should account for the unique nature of socialization. Each game would have a different culture because of this. With the understanding of how a person is altered through virtual stimulus, games can be made to use this aspect to improve a person's health and well-being.

Academic freedom is fundamental to higher learning. Most colleges and universities guarantee academic freedom to faculty members in teaching, research, and as citizens of a constitutional democracy. Colleges are also expected to protect all members of their communities from hostile environments that might impair their participation in educational activities. Administrative due process is essential to protecting academic freedom. However, the enthusiasm of those with an activist orientation may subvert administrative due process in favor of attaining the appearance of “social justice” by punishing (or canceling) those whose educational activities make others uncomfortable. Irrational beliefs, motivated reasoning, and nefarious narratives containing distortions and exaggerations precipitate apparent crises. Consequently, the perception of imminent danger may justify extraordinary measures such as punishments including suspension, banishment, termination of tenure, and dismissal. As part of an industrial/organizational psychology course, the authors developed a survey to measure the effects of identity and beliefs on perceptions and judgments about hostile environments and academic freedom. The results from a representative sample of 120 self-selected respondents revealed that gender and sexual orientation influenced political identity and beliefs about hostile environments. Together, identity and beliefs predicted over half the variance in the perception of hostile environments. However, the strongest relationship was between the perception of environmental hostility and respondents' judgments about actions believed to have contributed to these environments. These words or behaviors were judged not be protected by academic freedom. Ironically, this fundamental dissonance suggests that academic freedom may only be protected in situations when it is not needed.

In a study that looked at recidivism in over 40 states, over 40% of offenders returned to state prison within three years of their release from correctional custody. In this study we are looking at how strongly related is the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) on measuring recidivism. Using PsycInfo and Google Scholar, we searched terms “PCL-R and recidivism,” and we located 20 studies that included data that answered our research question for our meta-analysis. We looked at the PCL-R's three main factors (Total, Factor 1, and Factor 2) and compared them to three categories of recidivism (general, violent, and sexual). PCL-R Total and general recidivism had a weighted average correlation r = .28, violent total had r = .25, and sexual total had r = .20. Our findings show a medium relationship between the three types of recidivism and the PCL-R indicating that the PCL-R is a strong suitor for determining whether an individual will reoffend and the type of re-offense they are likely to commit. These findings suggest that this can help the court system decide on the punishment lengths.

Adult male spiders midst courtship displays respond to predatory avian cues in one of two ways, they either attempt to escape or freeze. While juvenile spiders are not capable of courtship displays, they may still respond similarly to predatory cues in other contexts, such as foraging. To test if juvenile wolf spiders respond to avian cues during foraging, we collected 3rd – 4th instar spiderlings from the field in October (2019, 2020) and brought them to the lab. In the 1st experiment (2019), we introduced a live cricket into an arena while also playing back avian cues via a substrate-borne vibrational playback system. In the 2nd experiment (2020), we controlled all cues by playing a video of a cricket coupled with its vibrational cues while simultaneously playing avian cues as in the 1st experiment. The results of both experiments yielded no significant affect between predator cues and antipredator behaviors in juvenile wolf spiders, although there were some interesting trends. We plan to improve our experimental approach in future iterations of this research and continue to investigate foraging behavior in juvenile wolf spiders.

The Pacific mackerel, Scomber japonicus, commonly referred to as the chub mackerel, is a species of fish belonging to the family Scombridae. Little is known about the anatomy of the inner ear in many marine fish species, including those of the Scombridae family. Thus, we examined the inner ear of Scomber japonicus. The specimens used for morphological examination were fixed in a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde and filtered seawater. Following water rinses, the specimens' auditory systems were dissected under a microscope using fine dissection tools. The auditory systems of the specimens were examined on three levels of structure: whole structure of the auditory system, otoliths, and patterns of sensory hair cells. The whole structure examination involved analysis of the major parts of the auditory system- the semicircular canals, lagenae, saccules, and utricles. Second, we examined the otoliths, calcium carbonate bony structures that reside in the saccule, utricle, and lagena of fishes. Otolith ultrastructure was examined via the use of light and scanning electron microscopy. Lastly, patterns of the auditory hair cells were visualized via fluorescence microscopy of phalloidin-labeled hair cell stereocilia. The information gained from this research can be used for comparative studies with other members of the Scombridae family and more taxonomically-distant species. This comprehensive description of Scomber japonicus's inner ear structure also provides a baseline for future studies on how underwater anthropogenic sound may damage the auditory system of this species.

Increasing environmental temperatures may have a direct impact on stream ecosystems. Elevated stream temperatures could influence fitness of fish that are exposed to these conditions. To determine fitness, aerobic scope measurements were taken in three Kentucky stream fish species (Etheostoma caeruleum, Gambusia affinis, and Pimephales notatus) in response to various temperatures (13°C, 18°C, 23°C, and 28°C). Calculations of aerobic scope were determined by taking the difference between the maximum metabolic rate [MMR] and the standard metabolic rate [SMR] of each fish. To conduct this experiment, a static-flow respirometry system was used to record the MMR and SMR of the three fish species. Comparisons between species and thermal conditions were established with the finding of mass-specific metabolic rates by measuring fish mass (0.01g). Overall, drastic changes in temperatures may affect the entire life history stages of the fish species. Comparisons of aerobic scope can then be made between the expected thermal conditions and current thermal conditions. Adult Gambusia affinis used for breeding are being maintained at two temperatures, one consistent with the actual stream temperature and the other temperature was maintained at +3°C higher to imitate expected elevated stream temperature. Fry and juveniles are kept in temperatures reflecting current stream temperatures and future temperatures until mature enough to be placed in the static-flow respirometry system for metabolic rate analysis. Understanding the metabolic responses that these fish species have toward fluctuating thermal conditions helps us determine the adaptive abilities these species have on future warmer temperatures brought by climate change.

American Bluets, like their name implies, are only found throughout North America. They are members of the genera Houstonia, Stenaria, and Stenotis which comprise about 38 species. Over the years, it has become apparent that Houstonia as well as its other allies in the family Rubiaceae are quite difficult to taxonomize due to differing phylogenetic opinions. The most recent molecular study (Shanks 2015 and Neupane et al. 2017) based on nuclear (ITS) and plastid (trnL-F, rps16) DNA does not support genera Stenaria and Houstonia as monophyletic. The status of Stenotis in respect to Houstonia and Arcytophyllum was also unresolved. Our study, based on whole-genome plastid data, attempts to resolve the phylogeny of this taxonomically difficult group comprising Stenaria, Houstonia, and Stenotis as well as their relationship with South American Arcytophyllum. This work is a part of the ongoing efforts of building a global phylogeny of the tribe Spermacoceae.
