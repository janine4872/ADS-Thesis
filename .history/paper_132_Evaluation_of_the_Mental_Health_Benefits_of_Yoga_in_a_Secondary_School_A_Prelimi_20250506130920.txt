Abstract
The goal of this study was to evaluate potential mental health benefits of yoga for adolescents in
secondary school. Students were randomly assigned to either regular physical education classes or
to 11 weeks of yoga sessions based upon the Yoga Ed program over a single semester. Students
completed baseline and end-program self-report measures of mood, anxiety, perceived stress,
resilience, and other mental health variables. Independent evaluation of individual outcome
measures revealed that yoga participants showed statistically significant differences over time
relative to controls on measures of anger control and fatigue/inertia. Most outcome measures
exhibited a pattern of worsening in the control group over time, whereas changes in the yoga group
over time were either minimal or showed slight improvements. These preliminary results suggest
that implementation of yoga is acceptable and feasible in a secondary school setting and has the
potential of playing a protective or preventive role in maintaining mental health.

Introduction
Adolescents are confronted with a variety of life stressors from both school and home.
Unmanaged stress is now believed to be a contributing and/or causal factor in the development of
mental health and behavioral problems that are prevalent in adolescents, including anxiety,
depression, and behavioral problems 1
. A recent survey study indicated that 7.5% of adolescents
meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria
for one or more mental health conditions. The authors concluded that life stressors were the most
consistent predictive factor across disorders. Furthermore, personal resources such as mastery were
consistently associated with enhanced resilience to the onset of mental health disorder episodes 2
.
Reinforcing the rationale for addressing adolescent mental health needs, it is estimated that one half
of the adult population will experience at least one DSM-IV mental health disorder. The age of
onset of most of these disorders, including the most seriously impairing conditions, occurs in
childhood and adolescence 3
. It has therefore been suggested that greater attention and effort should
be devoted to interventions for the treatment of the mild and currently largely untreated child–
adolescent disorders. This would address the significant adolescent mental health burden and also
possibly prevent the high severity and prevalence of adult primary and comorbid mental health
disorders 3
.
Accordingly, there has been some development and evaluation of a variety of school-based stress
management and wellness programs in the hope of providing adequate coping strategies, enhanced
resilience, and self-efficacy 4,5
. Elements of these programs include cognitive restructuring, social
skills, problem solving training, emotional self-control techniques, modeling, role play, and
relaxation skills training 4,5
. However, few programs have incorporated mind–body skills
approaches such as yoga and meditation, which are known to be effective self-regulatory and
stress management skills.
Yoga is a holistic system of multiple mind body practices for mental and physical health that
include physical postures and exercises, breathing techniques, deep relaxation practices, cultivation
of awareness/mindfulness, and meditation. Yoga and meditation techniques have been shown to
reduce perceived stress 6,7 and improve mood 8
. Research documenting the therapeutic benefits of
yoga has grown steadily for the past three decades and now includes controlled clinical trials on a
variety of mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety. A bibliometric analysis of
published research studies on yoga as a therapeutic intervention has revealed almost 50 published
studies up to 2003 evaluating yoga for mental health conditions, all of which reported some
positive benefits 9
. Furthermore, yoga has been recommended and used clinically for both children
and adolescents 10. Two recent systematic reviews of yoga research in pediatric populations
concluded that there is credible preliminary evidence for the efficacy of yoga for a variety of
mental and physical health outcomes 11,12.
Yoga and meditation techniques seem ideally suited to prevent or alleviate the psychological
issues encountered by secondary school adolescents. Components of yoga practice have been
incorporated into stress management programs in schools, including relaxation techniques such as
muscle relaxation and regulation of breathing 4,5
. There is currently substantial interest in the
development and application of meditation-based interventions in school settings for improvement
of both mental health and performance 13–16. There is some research support for meditationmediated improvements, and this literature has been increasing recently. For example, studies have
shown improvements in: (1) test anxiety and field independence in elementary school students 17;
(2) objective measures of stress including heart rate and blood pressure in prehypertensive African
American adolescents 18,19; (3) work habits, cooperation, and academic performance in middle
school students; 20; and (4) restful alertness, emotional intelligence, and academic performance in
middle school students 21. There is also a preliminary report of benefits from a combined Tai Chi
and mindfulness-based stress reduction program 22.
Mental Health Benefits of Yoga in a Secondary School KHALSA et al. 81
Although it is likely that there is increasing implementation of yoga in school settings, 10 there
are few published research studies. Most of these have been single-group trials and in special
populations or schools. All of them were conducted in elementary school children and only one of
them examined yoga implementation within the regular school curriculum. A pair of early studies
reported benefits of yoga on tension and concentration in children with educational problems in a
specialty school 23,24. A 4-year German school study of a relaxation program incorporating yoga
for fifth grade students with abnormal examination anxiety showed significant improvements in
aggression, helplessness in school, static balance ability, physical complaints, and stress-coping
abilities 25. A single-group study in four Israeli elementary schools of a 13-session, 4-month yoga
intervention within the school curriculum reported improvements in children’s concentration,
mood, and ability to function under pressure as evaluated by the school teachers 26. A controlled
study of an after-school yoga program in inner city elementary school students showed
improvement in negative behaviors scores and well-being 27. Finally, in a randomized controlled
trial in four urban Baltimore elementary schools, a 12-week after-school yoga program was shown
to have a positive impact on problematic responses to stress, including rumination, intrusive
thoughts, and emotional arousal 28. The purpose of the present study was to employ a preliminary,
exploratory evaluation to identify which psychological constructs may be useful to include in
future studies to evaluate the psychological benefits of an in-curriculum yoga program in secondary
school adolescents.
Methods
Study population
Adolescents in 7 grade 11 and 12 classes in a Massachusetts rural secondary school were
enrolled in the study through a passive consent, opt-out procedure. The school had a 90% white
student body demographic and a 17% low-income population. All students and parents or
guardians were informed that the students would be participating in a yoga study and could be
assigned to either the active intervention or the control condition. There were no exclusion criteria.
The research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Brigham and Women’s
Hospital. Participants were randomly assigned by class to a physical education-classes-as-usual
group (no treatment control; three classes) or to a yoga group (active treatment; four classes).
Intervention
Participants in the yoga intervention attended two to three yoga sessions per week during the 11-
week program during which either 23, 25, 31, or 32 sessions were held (depending upon the class).
Yoga sessions were 30 min (three classes) or 40 min (one class) long and were held either two
times (two classes) or three times (two classes) per week. (For the sake of clarity, a yoga instruction
period will be referred to as a yoga “session”, whereas a “class” refers to the grouping of students).
The yoga program was a modified version of the Yoga Ed program for secondary schools that is
currently being implemented in a number of schools across the United States (http://www.yogaed.
com). This secular program includes simple yoga postures, breathing exercises, visualization, and
games with an emphasis on fun and relaxation and minimizing risk without unduly complex or
physically athletic or demanding techniques. An important component of the program also includes
development and training in the cognitive skills of mindfulness and self-awareness and a yogabased psychological and philosophical attitude. Each of the yoga instructors underwent a formal
Yoga Ed training course had also both undergone a 200-h yoga teacher training program in the
Kripalu yoga style.
82 The Journal of Behavioral Health Services & Research 39:1 January 2012
Typical 30-min Yoga Ed sessions were structured to include a 5-min initial relaxation or “time
in,” a 5-min warm-up, 15 min of yoga poses, and a 5-min closing relaxation (times were extended
for the 40-min sessions). Breathing techniques were incorporated during the initial relaxation and
throughout the sessions. Each of the sessions had a theme or talking point that was discussed by the
instructor during the session including the following: yoga philosophy and methodology (postures,
breathing, relaxation, meditation, awareness), non-violence, mind–body interactions and awareness, body systems, stress management, emotional intelligence, self-talk and critical voice,
contentment, discipline, decision making, values and principles, commitment, and acceptance.
Measures
Study staff administered a battery of self-report questionnaires to all classes in two sittings just
prior to the start of the yoga program in mid-September, 2008, and again shortly after the end of
the yoga program in mid-December. A few subjects (N=6) who missed the mid-December classadministered questionnaire sitting completed their questionnaires 3 weeks later. Yoga session
attendance and spontaneous student comments, responses, and reactions to the yoga were recorded
by the instructors.
The Self-Report of Personality (SRP) version of the Behavior Assessment Survey for Children
Version 2 (BASC-2) for children aged 12 to 21 years provides insight into thoughts and feelings
and includes validity scales for helping judge the quality of completed forms. It provides a global
score, subscale scores, and composite subscale scores (see Table 1) calculated as T-scores which
provide cutoff thresholds for at-risk and clinically significant scores. The SRP includes 179 items
with either true/false questions or four-point Likert-type scale questions for which higher response
options indicate greater frequency and takes about 30 min to complete. Extensive BASC-2
psychometric properties are reported in the manual and are, overall, considered strong 29.
The Profile of Mood States short form (POMS-SF) is a shortened version of the POMS and
provides a total mood disturbance score as well as subscale scores for six mood states
(Table 1) 30. It consists of 30 mood-related adjectives that are rated on a five-point scale
ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). The POMS-SF is a reliable and internally
consistent self-report questionnaire that has been validated on adult and college student
populations although not with adolescents.
The Resilience Scale (RS) 31 measures the degree of individual resilience, commonly defined as
a positive personality characteristic that moderates the negative effects of unmanaged stress and
enhances individual adaptation. It is the capability of successfully coping with challenge, change,
or misfortune. All 25 items in this scale are scored on a seven-point scale from 1=disagree to 7=
agree. All items are worded positively and possible scores range from 25 to 175 with higher scores
reflecting higher resilience. The scale has demonstrated internal consistency, reliability, and
concurrent validity and has been recommended as the best instrument for measuring resilience in
adolescents 32.
The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is the most widely used psychological instrument for
measuring the perception of stress 33. It is a measure of the degree to which situations in one’s life
are appraised as stressful. Items were designed to tap how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and
overloaded respondents find their lives. The scale also includes a number of direct queries about
current levels of experienced stress. Respondents complete 10 items answering on a Likert scale
from 0 (never) to 4 (very often) as to how often they felt a certain way over the past month. The
PSS has adequate internal reliability although it has not been validated in adolescents.
The Inventory of Positive Psychological Attitudes-32R (IPPA) provides a total score and
subscales that measure Self-confidence during Stress and Life Purpose and Satisfaction. This selfreport instrument includes 32 items answered on a seven-point Likert scale. It has been shown to
Mental Health Benefits of Yoga in a Secondary School KHALSA et al. 83
possess adequate reliability and construct validity in adults but has not been validated in
adolescents 34.
Data analysis
Subjects in separate classes were pooled together into yoga and control groups for analysis. To
test whether there was an effect of class, ANOVAs were conducted on each outcome variable with
the seven-category class variable as a predictor, and no effects of class were found. All global and
subscale scores of the questionnaires were analyzed with a series of independent-sample t tests on
the difference scores (posttest minus pretest) of the yoga and control groups. When significant
differences were found between the yoga and control groups, separate one-sample t tests were
performed on the difference scores for the two groups to examine the pattern of the within-group
differences. Standardized effect sizes for each outcome measure were calculated as the difference
between the mean changes of the yoga and control groups divided by the standard deviation.
Secondary analyses included Pearson product–moment correlations to examine the effects of
attendance on the outcomes as well as independent-sample t tests to test for gender differences. The
statistical analyses were performed with SAS, v. 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc.); the alpha level used to
determine significance was pG0.05 for all analyses.
Results
Parents or guardians of 136 students received a consent letter. Of these, 11 students changed their
class elective schedule options and four students/parents declined participation for religious
reasons. The remaining 121 students (51 females, 70 males) age 15–19 years (M=16.8 years, SD=
0.6) began participation in the study and were randomly assigned by classes: 74 students in four
classes to the Yoga Ed group (34 females, 40 males, M=16.8 year, SD=0.6), 47 students in three
classes to the control group (17 females, 30 males, M=16.9 year, SD=0.8). Of these 121 students,
ten students dropped the physical education elective (two Yoga Ed, eight controls), one student
(yoga) was suspended, and one additional student declined to participate in the yoga for religious
reasons. Although outcome data are not available for these 12 students, their baseline data were
compared with those of the students who remained in the study. Only one significant difference
was found between the dropouts and the other participants on the pretest variables: the dropouts
scored significantly higher on the PSS (20.6 vs. 17.3; t=−2.05, p=.042).
Of the 74 students in the yoga group, 73 took at least one yoga session. Yoga sessions for some
of the classes were cancelled due to school events (e.g., student assembly, bomb scare, etc.) on six
different days. Attendance was analyzed both in terms of number of sessions attended and the
percentage of available sessions attended. The average number of sessions attended for all 73
students was 20.5 (SD=7.7), for the students with ~2 sessions per week was 18.0 (SD=5.1) and for
the students with ~3 sessions per week was 23.7 (SD=9.2). The average number of missed sessions
for all students was 7.4 (SD=6.0), and the percentage of available sessions attended was 73.4%
(SD=0.2%). Yoga session attendance was just over 80% at the beginning of the yoga program and
declined to just under 70% by the end. Although control group attendance was not taken,
historically, the level of yoga attendance was similar to that of the physical education classes.
No significant baseline differences were detected between groups. Three variables showed
statistically significant change from baseline to end-program in the yoga group compared with the
control group (Fig. 1). The amount of change in resilience as measured by the RS was significantly
different between the yoga and control groups (p=0.014). The yoga group had an insignificant
increase in resilience from 131.5 (SD=15.4) to 133.6 (SD=16.0), (p=0.192), whereas the control
group significantly decreased from 131.2 (SD=18.5) to 126.5 (SD=21.9), (p=0.040). There was a
significant difference in change between the groups for the BASC-2 subscale of Anger Control (p=

Secondary analyses
Yoga session attendance data for students in the yoga intervention group showed significant
positive correlations with the change in IPPA total score (r=0.25, p=0.041) and the change in IPPA
Life Purpose and Satisfaction subscale score (r=0.26, p=0.035). There was also a significant
negative correlation between attendance and the change in Total Mood Disturbance Score on the
POMS-SF (r=−0.31, p=0.012; with a significant decrease in the subscale of Tension/Anxiety (r=
−0.25, p=0.041). A significant correlation was also observed between attendance and change in the
BASC-2 subscale Attitude to School (r=−0.24, p=0.046). There were no significant gender
differences in the amount of change in study variables.
General observations, anecdotes, and spontaneous student comments recorded by the yoga
instructors included issues affected by yoga practice related to mental state and behavior. Students
frequently commented on the relaxing effect of the yoga sessions and their learned ability to relax,
such as: “…enjoyed being able to let go of everything, zone out and relax.”; “…felt like the class
was a relaxing prep for the rest of the day.”; and “Savasana [supine deep relaxation] made me relax
and calmed me down.” Improvements in coping with stress were also commonly noted in
comments such as: “…an opportunity to de-stress in the middle of the day and recollect myself…it
gave me tools to use in everyday life, now I have techniques to de-stress myself on my own.”
General improvements in mood and positive affect were also commonly reported, as reflected in
comments such as: “I could reflect on my day in a positive way. This class gave me more energy
and made me more content.”; “…helped me improve my posture. I’ve had feedback from friends
and family that I’m more centered.”; and “The challenging postures were positive for me, I liked
pushing myself. I always felt more relaxed after the class.” Some students remarked on
improvements in sleep. Yoga instructors noted that many students made visible improvements in
proper execution/alignment of the yoga postures and understanding of the yoga practices in
general.
Discussion
This study demonstrated that inclusion of a semester-long regular yoga intervention is feasible in
a high school setting within the school curriculum. Out of 136 potential participants in the study,
only five declined to participate for religious reasons, whereas most all other non-participants
dropouts were due to schedule/class elective changes. Among students randomly assigned to the
yoga intervention, attendance was high and similar to the school's typical physical education class
attendance levels. This attendance and the generally positive qualitative feedback suggest that the
yoga was perceived as an acceptable practice by both parents and students in this setting.
Although statistically significant differences between groups were found for only a few outcome
measures, each of these favored the yoga group (Table 1). On most measures, findings suggested
relatively small positive effects in the yoga group but marked declines in the control group, as
illustrated in the BASC-2 Anger Control and Attitude to School subscales and the RS (Fig. 1 and
Table 1). One exception to this was the Fatigue/Inertia subscale in which there was a relatively
strong improvement in the yoga group (Fig. 1). Given that this study was conducted over a single
fall semester and the post-program outcome measures were near the end of term, it is possible that
the pattern of worsening in the controls was due the end-of-term exam stress.
Three constructs were identified with statistically significant improvements among yoga
participants versus controls: Anger (BASC-2 Anger Control subscale), resilience (RS), and
Fatigue/Inertia (POMS-SF). The beneficial effect on anger control (and a trend in the POMS-SF
Anger/Hostility subscale) are consistent with the hypothesized improvements in emotional
intelligence/stability (self-control, self-reflection/awareness, and flexibility in emotional response)
for meditative interventions in adolescents 16, with the few previous studies that have reported
Mental Health Benefits of Yoga in a Secondary School KHALSA et al. 87
improvements with meditation 21 or yoga 25,27, and with reports of positive mood changes in most
of the elementary school-based yoga studies 23,24,26,28. The maintenance in resilience by the yoga
participants, as compared with the significant decrements in control subjects, suggest that yoga
may promote the kind of equanimity and personal resources that are associated with successful
coping with stress and adversity and a protective/preventive effect of yoga on mental health. This
positive role of yoga for stress management has been demonstrated repeatedly in adult studies of
yoga practice 6,7
, represents a major reason for participation in yoga practices 35, and has also been
reported in all of the elementary school-based studies 23–28. Although it is plausible that
improvements in fatigue/inertia are associated with yoga practice, it was somewhat surprising
given the lack of statistically significant improvements of a number of other outcome measures that
would have been more expected with a yoga intervention such as perceived stress, tension/anxiety,
self-esteem, self-reliance, and somatization. One explanation could be the improvement in sleep
anecdotally reported by beginning yoga students and also noted by some of the students in this
study, which would improve daytime wakefulness and reduce sleepiness and fatigue 36.
Study limitations
Only a few showed outright statistical significance or trends between groups. There are several
possible methodological reasons for this. For instance, the BASC-2 is a clinical instrument
designed for identifying psychopathology in adolescents. Given that the high school participating
was a rural high school with a largely normative population, the BASC-2 may not be the best
instrument to identify subtle improvements in psychological variables. Another limitation may be
that the duration of the intervention was only one semester long and perhaps insufficient to yield
more significant outcomes. Finally, it should be borne in mind that this study was actually a
comparative evaluation between Yoga Ed sessions and regular physical education classes, which
themselves have psychological and physical benefits that overlap those of yoga. A comparative
study of a curriculum of both physical education and yoga sessions combined with a curriculum of
only physical education classes may reveal a stronger improvement in the yoga outcomes.
However, such a study protocol might require a reduction in the number of yoga sessions due to
scheduling constraints, and it also may be difficult to implement in many schools.
Other study limitations were related to the exploratory nature of the investigation. The statistical
analysis did not include adjustments for intention to treat or for multiple comparisons, so these
results must be interpreted rather cautiously. In fact, at least two significant associations could be
expected just by chance alone (type I errors), and any correction for multiple comparisons would
render all of the results as not statistically significant. The strategies adopted to address these issues
(i.e., comparing dropouts on baseline measures and limiting the number of tests conducted by
using summary measures rather than all subscales) mitigate the limitations somewhat. In addition,
subjects from each of the classes were pooled into yoga and control conditions. Although the
effects of nesting in classes were tested, the small number of total classes limited a comprehensive
investigation of a number of potentially important within-class factors such as the different
instructors, time of day, specific curriculum differences, and any other characteristics shared by
students in each class. Furthermore, the lack of blinding of subjects may have influenced the results
with a positive expectation. There were also a number of irregularities in the study execution due to
the constraints of incorporating the study into an ongoing curriculum. These included variable
lengths of intervention, session frequency, duration of sessions, late acquisition of some outcome
measures at end-treatment, and cancelled sessions.
The goal of this preliminary and exploratory study was to identify potential mental health
characteristics that might be influenced by a yoga intervention; thus, while the above study
limitations require caution in interpretation of results, a range of mental health constructs have been
identified which may benefit from further study.

Implications for Behavioral Health
The results of this study are particularly important and currently relevant given the association
between psychosocial stressors and the risk of first incidence of mental health conditions in adolescents 2
. If future studies of the delivery of a yoga intervention to adolescents in the secondary school setting
detect improvements in stress-related measures, this may prove to be a useful preventive/protective
practice for mental health in adolescents. This is especially noteworthy given the lack of existing school
resources dedicated to stress management and resilience enhancement. Further studies of yoga
interventions in urban public schools with a variety of outcome measures and longer treatment protocols
would fulfill a stated need to preventively treat what are initially mild child–adolescent disorders 3
