A study was conducted to identify beneficial insects found in late-planted Bt sweet corn, native perennial, and pasture border habitats. Anthem II Bt and Roundup protected Sweet corn (Zea mays L. var saccharata) was planted July 13, 2020 at the Kentucky State University Harold R. Benson Research and Demonstration Farm, Frankfort, Kentucky. Each plot was bordered by either native perennial plants or pasture borders. The native perennial borders were composed of Big bluestem, Thimbleweed, Smooth blue aster, New England aster, Side-oats Grama, Purple coneflower, Rattlesnake master, Joe-Pye weed, Common boneset, Blue lobelia, Bee balm, Prairie switch grass, Foxglove beardtongue, Hairy beardtongue, Slender mountain mint, Gray-headed coneflower, Little bluestem, Gray goldenrod, and Prairie dropseed. Pasture borders were composed of Johnson grass, orchard grass, giant foxtail, red clover, pigweed, and several other species of broadleaf weedy forbes. Yellow sticky traps 15 cm × 15 cm were deployed to trap beneficial insects. Traps were stapled to tobacco sticks at ear height one week after the planting date on the border rows and at the time of silking in the corn plots. The traps were collected and replaced weekly. Beneficial insects were identified and the data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Excel. Species of insects found were minute pirate bug (Orius spp.), pink lady beetle (Coleomegilla maculata), multicolored Asian lady beetles (Harmonia axyridis), spotless lady beetle (Cycloneda munda), and big eyed bugs (Geocoris spp.).The most abundant beneficial insect in the three different habitats was minute pirate bug followed by pink lady beetle.

Urban forests impact all types of local wildlife, but birds may be an especially important indicator of ecosystem health in newly reforested areas. Birds perform key functions in ecosystems as they regulate insect populations, disperse seeds as they travel between habitats, and even (in some cases) perform pollination. Urbanization has fragmented interior habitat, leaving urban sites unsuitable for many bird species. Reforestation is a potentially important solution because it recreates forested habitats within urban settings, allowing wildlife species to return and live cohesively with the human population surrounding it. In this study, investigators surveyed bird communities in a 20-year chronosequence of urban sites in Lexington, KY, planted as part of the Reforest the Bluegrass program. Bird diversity and abundance were recorded at three patches within each of twenty reforested sites, ranging from approximately 40-80 meters in diameter. Species richness ranged from 5-21 bird species per site. Preliminary analysis suggests that older sites with a closed canopy tended toward higher species richness and greater abundance than younger sites lacking a closed canopy (e.g., 19 vs. 5 species). Similarly, larger sites tended toward higher richness than smaller sites (e.g., 14 vs. 9 species). These data suggest that reforested urban sites may become increasingly useful to birds over time, emphasizing the importance of long-term planning and management for development of older planted forests. Further research will be necessary to clarify whether species richness increases as the urban forests mature, and if migration patterns affect bird species richness within certain time frames.

The safety and performance of phytogenics and synbiotics as viable alternatives to antibiotics has been demonstrated in intensive poultry production systems, but not on pasture. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of dietary supplementation of a phytogenic and symbiotic on the performance of pasture-based broilers. One day old sexed Cornish Cross broiler chicks were divided into 3 groups and fed a regular 18% CP chicken diet (Control), supplemented with phytogenic (Control+P) or symbiotic (Control+S). After 2 weeks of acclimation, the birds were blocked by weight and randomly allocated to the 3 dietary treatments in triplicates (45 per group; 15 per replicate), and then pastured on 3 pre-fabricated carports in defined replicates. Carports were moved daily to fresh pastures; birds had free access to feed and water, while feed intake (FI) and body weight (BW) were measured daily and weekly, respectively. Data were analyzed by GLMMIX procedure of SAS. There was no significant difference in ADG, and final BW between Control and Control+S. However, FI of broiler fed Control+S was significantly higher that the Control and Control+P groups. Broilers fed the Control diet had a better feed conversion ratio (FCR) than the supplemented groups. Meanwhile phytogenic supplementation (Control+P) suppressed FI resulting in lower BW, ADG. More studies are required to determine optimum concentrations and performance outcomes of phytogenics and synbiotics in pasture-based broiler productions systems.

Primocane-fruiting blackberries have the potential of producing two crops on same plant on same year through floricane and primocane fruiting. It is of great interest to farmers of Kentucky as it can provide an extended harvest from July through October. In May 2016, blackberry variety trial was established on certified organic land at the Kentucky State University (KSU) Research Farm. Three primocane-fruiting selections from University of Arkansas, ‘Prime-Ark® Traveler' ‘Stark® Black Gem®’, and ‘APF-268' were planted in a completely randomized design, with four replicate plots, each consisting five plants of each selection per plot. Two rows were spaced 4 meters apart and 5 groups of plants were spaced at 1.5 meters with plant to plant spacing of 0.6 meters. This trial was managed organically following the National Organic Program Standards. Ripe fruits were harvested from early July through October. Data were subjected to Analysis of Variance and Least Significant Means separation using CoStat Software (CoHort Software, Monterey, CA). In 2019, fruit weight and yield of ‘APF-268' was significantly higher than ‘Prime-Ark® Traveler' but not significantly different than ‘Stark® Black Gem®'. In 2020, there was no significant difference in the fruit weight and yield of three selections but the yield was more than twice the yield from 2019 in all selections. This can be attributed to the prolonged high summer temperatures of 2019. Further research should be conducted for formal recommendation, however based on the data of 2019 and 2020, ‘APF-268’ seems to be a promising selection for Kentucky.

Recently, hemp farming systems are increasingly popular in Kentucky replacing tobacco cropping systems. However, the study on the impacts of hemp cropping on soil properties is rarely conducted, resulting in limited data on soil's behavior/changes under these management practices. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine soil characteristics including compaction, acidity level, moisture level, and water retention. The measurements were collected from three different hemp fields, three crop rotation studies (in 2020 - corn, soybean, and tobacco) and a bare field adjacent to these fields. All fields are located at Murray State University West Farm, Calloway County, KY. Two soil depth intervals were used in this experiment 7.5 cm and 15 cm representing A horizon/topsoil. The results will be discussed in the presentation. The data from this research will be beneficial for producers and farm managers to predict the future of hemp production and corn-soybean-tobacco crop rotation on the soil's wellness to promote sustainable agriculture.

Hemp farming has been increasing in popularity in western Kentucky. Those who took the chance to grow hemp need ways to continue improving their crop. This experiment is designed to observe the effect of hydrogenated water to the growth of hemp plants. Practices used in this study include the infusion of hydrogen to hemp plants in two different methods: nanobubbles and regular drip infusion. In order to compare hemp growth, a control group with only municipal water was used. The results showed plants infused with hydrogen for the nanobubble method grew more than both the control and the regular hydrogen method. Although the nanobubble method was the leader in growth, the regular hydrogen infusing method still produced larger plants than the control group. Variables that are measured to determine hemp growth include height, CBD and THC levels, and chlorophyll. The detailed results will be discussed in the presentation.

Reforest the Bluegrass, an urban reforestation project in Lexington, Kentucky, engages members of the local community to plant native trees. Reforest the Bluegrass has planted a new site annually since 1999, yielding a chronosequence of reforested urban sites scattered across Lexington. During the summer of 2020, permanent fixed-radius monitoring plots were established in each planting site. Overstory trees were surveyed for height, DBH, and species in 1/50 ac plots. Understory woody plants were surveyed for height and species in 1/200 ac plots. Most sites planted before 2012 exhibited canopy closure and had begun the stem exclusion phase. American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) grew successfully in all stands where it was planted, recruiting into the overstory on older sites. Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) has also recruited into the overstory but has begun to decline due to pests, disease, and competition from slower-growing species. Ash (Fraxinus americana and Fraxinus pennsylvanica) mortality was high due to emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis). Understory plots often showed promising growth for species like white oak (Quercus alba). Many understory plots had an abundance of invasive species, such as Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) and Callery pear (Pyrus calleryana). These exotic species were not planted in these sites but rather established from surrounding residential areas. Preliminary results suggest that planted sites establish a diverse community over time but that further management (e.g., invasive species control) may be necessary to perpetuate a biodiverse community.

Although there are a growing number of farmers' markets (USDA, 2018), consumer attendance does not appear to be rising at the same rate, (Eggert & Biasillo, 2018). This study's purpose was to assess the statistical relationship between market attendance and consumer characteristics. A mail survey was distributed to 2,530 consumers in the South-Central Kentucky region. Consumer responses were analyzed using a multinomial logit model which regressed consumer demographics against three different habits of market attendance. The three habits of consumer attendance were Never Attend, Occasionally Attend, and Frequently Attend. Results indicate that respective relative probabilities of the three habits are 62%, 21%, and 17%. Four variables were significant in determining the probability of a consumer never attending a market. Those variables were ethnicity, satisfaction with previous market experiences, monthly spending on fresh produce, and the respondent's interest in using an app to purchase fresh produce. The marginal probabilities were - .17, -.15, -.002, and -0.57, respectively. Gender, satisfaction with previous market experiences, and monthly spending on fresh produce were significant in determining the probability of occasionally attending a market. Probabilities were .16, .001, and .06, respectively. This study also found that education and satisfaction with previous market experiences were significant in determining the probability of a consumer frequently attending a market. The marginal probabilities were .06 and .15, respectively. Farmers' market personnel should use these results to participate in focused advertising activities that would targets consumer sector(s) who would normally choose to not attend.

Community-supported agriculture (CSA) typically relies on local residents investing in farms by purchasing shares of produce and through sales made at farmers markets. CSA farms are smaller than conventional farms and can consequently be especially vulnerable to extreme events (e.g., high temperatures, drought) during the growing season. Maximizing the ability to provide popular crops desired by consumers (e.g., fresh lettuce in the hot summer months) can help these local farms remain economically sustainable. In northern Kentucky, lettuce is difficult to grow in the late summer months, as the mean temperature is often too high for it to persist. In this pilot study in Crestview Hills, KY, we grew seedlings of three varieties of Salanova lettuce and transplanted them into raised garden beds where their growth (length, width, height) was measured for six weeks in 2019 (August-September). Lettuce transplants were placed in a randomized block design within three shade cloth treatments [50% white fabric (50%W), 50% black fabric (50%B), 30% black fabric (30%W)]. We found there was a significant effect of shade treatment type, as all three Salanova varieties increased volume the most in the 50%W treatment. There was also a species effect, as the mean volume of Green Crisp was significantly greater than both Green Incised (124.4%) and Red Crisp (384.2%) across all shade treatments. We hope this pilot study can help us better understand agricultural challenges, help inform successful decisions made by CSA farms, and ultimately provide fresh produce for communities across longer periods of time.

Lettuce plants, Lactuca sativa, were eaten by the early Romans and Egyptians, and the ancient Greeks were among the first people to grow lettuce. Lettuce was one of the first plants brought to the New World by Christopher Columbus, and it remains an important agricultural crop that represents an essential nutrient source for a large portion of the world. An experiment was conducted to determine the impact of four soil amendments: sewage sludge (SS), horse manure (HM), chicken manure (CM), and vermicompost (VERMI) on the yield and quality of three lettuce varieties (Romaine, Bibb, and Butterhead). Plants were grown in 45 plots, representing 3 replications of 5 different soil treatments (four soil amendments and native soil used as a control treatment) and 3 lettuce varieties. At maturity, plants were harvested, weighed, and classified according to the USDA grades into US Fancy, US No. 1, US No. 2, and culls. Overall results revealed that yield obtained from SS treatment was significantly greater (783 g plant –1) than that of VERMI treatment (663 g plant –1). In addition, variety Romaine produced the greatest plant weight (1.2 kg plant–1) compared to Bibb and Butterhead cultivars (0.51 and 0.49 kg plant–1, respectively). Using the USDA lettuce grades, US No.1 grade had the greatest total weight compared to US No. 2 and Fancy. We recommended the use of variety Romaine for growing lettuce in soil amended with SS for greater head yield.

The United States is the world's largest producer and exporter of several agriculture commodities; the two largest exports are corn and soybeans. According to the United States Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service, as of September 2020, corn production in Kentucky is forecast at 259 million bushels, up 6% from 2019. Soybean production is forecast to be 101 million bushels, up 30% since 2019. Shelby County is a semi-rural county in Kentucky consisting of 983 km2, located in the interior plateau ecoregion, and receives average annual precipitation amounts of 42 inches. Corn and soybeans are a powerful economic force with global impacts. Regionally, corn and soybeans are the driving force for livestock feed production and other industrial applications. Due to the importance of these crops, monitoring the production of these commodities is vital to assisting farmers and aiding policymaking. Remotely sensed multispectral data provides the potential to access the production and health of corn and soybean production in Shelby County, Kentucky, and determine the early agricultural forecast accuracy. This study aims to develop procedures for utilizing geospatial applications to aid in crop production and provide reliable methods of assessing the accuracy of commodity forecast.

Ultrasonography is a well-developed technology that interconverts electric and acoustic energy to create a gray-scale image of internal anatomy for diagnostic examinations. It was first used in human diagnostics (1940s) and in reproductive applications in veterinary medicine (1960s). Since then, the aquaculture industry has capitalized on ultrasound imaging, incorporating it into routine operations. The goal of this review was to examine the use of ultrasonography in fisheries and aquaculture. The following were identified: study purpose, species, ultrasonography settings and procedures, results, and implication of the findings. Studies demonstrated effective use of ultrasonography for sex identification and assessment of reproductive condition of various species of fish. Other studies addressed internal fish abnormalities, fish disease, blood flow, and internal disorders in ornamental fish. In aquaculture, the main purpose of ultrasonography was to evaluate sex and reproductive status for commercially raised fish such as salmon, catfish, sturgeon, and bass. In fisheries, ultrasonography was used as a non-intrusive method for sex identification, habitat restoration, and data on reproductive condition for wild and endangered species such as pallid sturgeon, Scaphirhynchus albus; Chinook Salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawtytscha; and Sevengill Shark, Notorynchus cepedianus. Ultrasound technology has clearly made an impact on wild, endangered, and aquaculture species by enabling safe, non-intrusive examinations. It has generated rapidly accessible biological data for use in fisheries management and aquaculture; it has provided data on high variability of ultrasound equipment, species size and morphology; and it has highlighted the need for a systematic approach for ultrasound imaging in fish.

Intensive production of largemouth bass (LMB) requires production of fingerlings approximately one month old (phase I) for feed training. Intensive indoor systems are constrained by foods required by the fish. Dedicated nursery ponds can be managed for abundant food, but recovery of fish and damage during harvest are issues. Cannibalism may occur if fry of different sizes from different spawns are stocked together. In this study, a floating raceway was designed as a nursery for LMB with natural food from the pond, but confinement in the raceway.

Three floating nursery raceways were designed and constructed for production of phase I LMB and were each placed in a separate 0.1-acre pond. Three 0.1-acre ponds were managed as a control. The six ponds were fertilized to produce an abundant food supply. Raceway flow was 15 gpm. Each unit was stocked with 6,000 fry and drained at harvest. Mean recovery of LMB after 27 days was 41% from floating raceways and 98% from nursery ponds. Mean recovery of fish escaped from the raceways was 48% of the total stocked. Mean weight of fish from nursery ponds was significantly greater than fish from floating raceways.

The floating nursery successfully produced phase I LMB, but escapement and food availability arose as issues that can be addressed. Harvesting fish in the floating nurseries was easier than harvesting the fish in ponds. The suspended floating raceway design used is affordable and easily constructed. Farmers could manage one nursery pond with several raceways to grow multiple groups separately.

Fish health professionals in Kentucky are able to identify and recommend treatment for fish health concerns to reduce morbidity and mortality of fish including those raised on farms. Fish diseases affect commercial aquaculture production, and significant losses may result. Fish pathologists at the Kentucky State University Fish Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (FDDL) helped significantly decrease fish mortality by accurately identifying pathogens and making proper treatment recommendations.

KSU FDDL staff advised a producer in August and September 2020 regarding mortality and abnormal swimming behavior in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). After several antibiotic treatments were administered unsuccessfully, two parasitic protozoans and external bacteria were identified as the mortality causative pathogens. Three treatment recommendations were made, and those results were reported.

Salt (NaCl) and copper sulfate (CuSO4) were applied at rates of 4 g/L and 4 mg/L, respectively. Follow-up examination of fish from the same population showed improvement in the gill tissues and no parasitic protozoans after 5 days. Columnaris, a disease caused by the bacterium Flavobacterium columnare, was identified in the follow-up exam. Harvester® herbicide (active ingredient diquat dibromide) was used and mortality was dramatically decreased.

The aquaculture industry has expressed interest in the use of the chemical diquat dibromide as a water cleanser for years. Lab trials have decreased columnaris associated mortality in walleye (Sander vitreus) using diquat (Bowker et al. 2016). However, clinical and toxicological research are limited for its value in largemouth bass production.

Local aquaculture allows farmers to provide a fresh fish product for their community, but as with any cultured animal, disease issues arise; therefore, it is essential that farmers understand fish health management. To assist fish farmers in raising a healthy fish stock, Kentucky State University (KSU) offers a fish disease diagnostic laboratory (FDDL) service to farmers in Kentucky and surrounding states free of charge. Fish health professionals at the KSU FDDL obtain fish and/or water samples from farmers via an Extension visit to the farm, or the farmer may send the samples to the KSU Aquaculture Research Center. Samples are analyzed in the FDDL and a final diagnosis is given to the farmer along with a treatment recommendation. The objectives of this study are to 1) better understand the needs of small-scale fish farmers in Kentucky and surrounding states, 2) help educate farmers on pathogen clinical signs and treatment options, and 3) evaluate which treatment method is preferred among fish farmers. This information, obtained by survey, will allow researchers to better understand fish disease treatment preferences of aquaculturists.

The objective of this project is to develop a clinical database for fish diseases that will allow fish professionals and veterinarians to track, record, and visualize fish disease outbreaks on their desktop or mobile device. The mobile responsive site will be designed by APAX Software located in Lexington, Kentucky. It will be programmed to track treatment methods, record if fish farmers applied the recommended treatment, and determine if the treatment was successful. Data will be collected from fish farms in Kentucky and the surrounding states via survey methods. The preliminary data has been collected from Kentucky State University's Fish Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, which include photographs and video footage compiled over the past 30 years of the laboratory's operation. The presentation will introduce a general outline of the project and the planned capabilities of the clinical database. Supplemental disease material will be available through the database and linked to Oregon State University's educational website for fish diseases,  www.fishpathogens.net. The supplemental material can be accessed by the public and used as an educational tool designed to inform fish farmers of possible fish diseases. The long-term goal is to create a database that incorporates disease cases from other professionals, in the United States and other countries, to assist in visualizing and interpreting outbreak trends, efficiency of treatment methods, and farming production cycles.

The mobility of four trace metals (Cr, Mo, Cu, and Zn) from soils amended with municipal sewage sludge (SS) into plants grown at three locations in Kentucky was investigated to compare metal concentrations in plants to their permissible standard limits. The field experiments were established at Meade, Adair, and Franklin Counties in Kentucky areas where commercial growers use SS as alternative to inorganic fertilizers. Soil and plant tissue were used for extraction and quantification of metals using Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) spectrometer. Results revealed that different trace metals had different uptake pattern by different plants. Cr concentrations in beans has shown very little indication of accumulation in bean seeds. Cr and Mo concentrations in plants grown at the three locations were below the permissible level of 1.3 µg g-1 tissue. Other than onion bulbs, Cu concentrations were above the permissible level of 10 µg g-1 tissue in plants grown at Meade site. At the Adair site, Cu was above the limit only in tobacco leaves. Whereas at Franklin site, Cu was above the limit in potato tubers, onion bulbs, and tomato fruits. Zn concentration in all plants tested never exceeded the permissible level of 0.6 µg g-1 tissue.

Lotus tuber is popular food item among Asian immigrants. There is no producers to supply this product in Kentucky. The supply provided from foreign imports is not fresh and of low quality. Our preliminary study proved that Kentucky climate supports the production of lotus plants. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of fertilization on the growth performance and production of a lotus variety selected for tuber production. Four levels of fertilization rates were tested in an experiment with 24 plastic containers (18-gallon volume). Half of the containers were provided with 30 g of a 10-10-10 fertilizer for vegetables from Southern State Cooperative. The containers were filled with garden soil to 40 cm deep and rain water collected from a barn roof was added into the containers to cover the soil to a depth 10 cm below the rim of the containers. One root tuber was planted into each container on May 1, 2019. Four levels of the same fertilizer mentioned above (7.5 g, 15 g, 22.5 g or 30 g) was applied to each container after at least one standing leave had grown up in June and July. The number of floating leaves, standing leaves, and flowers were counted each week. At the end of the experiment, lotus tubers were harvested from each container. Number of leaves reached the peak in August and died out toward the end of September. Production of lotus tuber was higher for containers supplied with the initial 30 g fertilizer but with no additional fertilizer application. Than those with additional fertilizer applications. Containers without the initial supply of 30 g fertilizer tended to have higher yield of tubers. These results suggest that initial supply of fertilizer to the containers may support tuber production without the need of later addition of fertilizers during the growing season.

Five soil management practices were used at the University of Kentucky Research Farm in Fayette County, Kentucky, to study the impact of soil amendments on the yield and quality of three cultivars of pumpkin (Renegade, Howden, and Gumdrop). The soil management practices were: sewage sludge (SS), chicken manure (CM), horse manure (HM), vermicompost (VERMI), and no-mulch (NM) native soil used for comparison purposes. At maturity, plants were harvested, weighed, and classified according to the USDA grades into US No. 1, US No. 2, and culls.

Overall results revealed that yield obtained from SS treatment was significantly greater (4.4 kg fruit–1) than that of NM treatment (3.6 kg fruit–1). In addition, cultivar Howden produced the greatest fruit weight (4.6 kg fruit–1) compared to Renegade and Gumdrop cultivars (4.1 and 3.3 kg fruit–1, respectively). Using the USDA pumpkin grades, US No. 1 grade had the greatest total weight compared to US No. 2 and culls. We recommend the use of variety Howden for growing pumpkin in soil amended with SS for greater yield and fruit quality.

Lotus can be propagated with tubers with a growing tip. Using part of a tuber will increase the number of propagates and save edible tubers for human consumption. The objective of this experiment was to determine the performance of lotus plants started with different type of propagates. A branch lotus tuber with 3 nodes, its top node with the tip or its sub-branch with a single node, the top node or the branch with a single node of a main lotus tuber was planted into plastic containers (18-gallon volume) in duplicates. The containers were filled with garden soil to 40 cm deep and rain water collected from a barn roof was added into the containers to cover the soil to a depth 10 cm below the rim of the containers. One root tuber was planted into each container on May 1, 2019. A 10-10-10 fertilizer for vegetable (Southern State Cooperative) was applied to each container (15 g/container) after at least one standing leave had grown up in June and July. The number of floating leaves, standing leaves, and flowers were counted each week. At the end of the experiment, lotus tubers were harvested from each container. Number of leaves reached the peak in August and died out toward the end of September. Number of leaves were slightly higher for lotus plants started from the top node of main tubers, but number of leaves were similar for all other groups. These results indicated that partial tubers may be used to start lotus plants without significant influence on their growth performance.

This study examines the use of agricultural technology by Kentucky small and mid-sized farmers. It also analyzes impact that the use has on farm productivity, farm profitability, and farm financial position. The data was collected using mailed survey to 870 small and medium-scale farmers throughout the Commonwealth of Kentucky. We found that 44.7 percent of these farmers are not adopting new agricultural technological advances in their operations. Among the 55.3 percent who use some sort of technology, 63.2 percent have seen positive impacts on productivity. We found that 38.3 percent of all respondents saw increase in their farm productivity and profitability and attributed it to the usage of new agricultural technologies. A majority (82.5 percent) of these farmers who use agricultural technology indicated that their operations are profitable or breaking even. We further found that younger (beginning farmers) are more likely to adopt new agricultural advances. This study is significant as it contributes to the knowledge about the use of new agricultural technologies among small and medium-scale farmers and its potential impact on farm productivity and profitability. This study is useful to extension agents and other institutions serving agriculture industry for the benefit small/medium-scale farmers.

Cancers have a highly heterogenous nature with multiple genetically different cell subpopulations vying for dominance through a process entitled cell competition. Prior research has revealed that the size of tumors may be restrained by competing subpopulations. It is hypothesized, that if the levels of intratumoral heterogeneity are increased, the resulting increase in cell competition may be tumor suppressive, as competing subpopulations of cells may eliminate each other rather than proliferating leading to slower tumor growth rates. The research focuses primarily on the outcomes of increasing cell competition in a tumor, rather than elucidating the processes by which they occur.

The computational model, written in Mathematica, follows the major rules of cell competition and simulates two-dimensional cell growth with multiple different subpopulations competing for dominance. Cells in the tumor are stochastically assigned arbitrary levels of fitness, creating selective pressures and stimulating cell competition. The levels of selective pressures in the cell were modified by changing the number of cell subtypes permitted in the tumor. Tumor growth was based on a stochastic growth model developed by Murray Eden. The growth rate of the tumor was monitored at different levels of selective pressures. Data collected from the computational model indicated that as the number of competing subpopulations increased, the tumor growth rate decreased.

This research improves our current understanding on how cell competition may be tumor suppressive. If increasing levels of intratumoral cell competition is proven to be tumor suppressive, it may be therapeutically useful in reducing the size of inoperable tumors.

Telomeres are regions of repetitive DNA at the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes. While telomeres play important roles in protecting the ends of chromosomes, they cannot be fully copied by the DNA replication machinery. To overcome this end-replication problem, an enzyme called telomerase adds sequences to the 3' end of the chromosome. Without telomerase activity, telomere lengths decrease and may be a leading cause of aging; while up-regulation of telomerase activity is implicated in >85% of cancers. Interestingly, prokaryotes have circular chromosomes that lack telomeres and these organisms have no need for telomerase. So, why did linear chromosomes, and thus the need for telomeres and telomerase, evolve?

To address this question, I am genetically engineering a circularized version of Chromosome XVI in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our method involves inserting DNA cassettes containing selectable markers at the ends of both arms of Chromosome XVI. The right arm will have a cassette with LEU2 and half of URA3 as the selectable markers, and the left arm will have a cassette with the other half of URA3 and HIS3. Once the cassettes have been integrated into both arms, we can select for a recombination event between the cassettes that joins the halves of URA3 and causes circularization. I have successfully confirmed integration of the cassettes in both arms of Chromosome XVI. I am currently selecting for the recombination event that will cause circularization utilizing this method. This experimental approach may eventually shed light on the evolution of linear chromosomes in eukaryotes.

The regulation of cell populations is the first natural defense against the emergence of cancer. Medulloblastomas are the most common form of pediatric brain cancer, and it is characterized by dysfunction in granule cell population control in the cerebellum. Myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) and p53 directly influence neuronal survival, proliferation, and apoptosis in granule cells during cerebellar development. Calcineurin binding protein 1 (Cabin1) has been demonstrated as a conserved regulator of MEF2 and p53. Cabin1 has been linked to numerous cancers, though not medulloblastoma. Despite this, Cabin1 has not been investigated in its role in cell population control in the cerebellum or in the incidence of medulloblastomas. The aim of this project is to investigate the roles of Cabin1 in the normal proliferation, apoptosis, and pruning of granule cell populations in embryonic cerebellum using immunohistochemistry and TUNEL staining in a Cabin1 knockdown model. This will help elucidate the functions and regulatory relationships of Cabin1 in neurodevelopment using D. rerio as the model system.

At the ends of linear chromosomes, there are regions of repeated nucleotide sequences called telomeres. In eukaryotic DNA replication, small sections of DNA are lost at the end. Telomerase adds nucleotides to the telomeres after each round of DNA replication to maintain the length of the telomeres in most eukaryotic organisms. Telomerase's ability to maintain the telomeres has profound effects in an organism; telomerase malfunctions are believed to be implicated in aging and cancer development. Since telomeres and telomerase have significant effects on an organism, the goal of this research is to gain insights into the evolutionary history and possible additional functions of telomeres and telomerase. To accomplish this, we are using a genetic engineering approach to circularize chromosomes to eliminate telomeres. Specifically, I am circularizing Chromosome XI of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. I will then monitor the viability and fitness of S. cerevisiae strains with a circularized Ch. XI. To circularize Ch. XI, I will insert DNA cassettes into the sub-telomeric regions at each end of Ch. XI. These cassettes each contain a complimentary half of the gene URA3. S. cerevisiae strains containing both cassettes will be placed onto media lacking uracil to select for recombination between the URA3 halves and chromosome circularization. I have successfully assembled both cassettes via PCR and inserted the left arm cassette into Ch. XI. If S. cerevisiae strains with a circularized Chromosome XI are sufficiently viable and fit, a long-term goal of this research is to engineer a strain containing only circular chromosomes.

Sleep and food consumption are two important homeostatically regulated behaviors essential for organisms' fitness, health, and longevity. These behaviors are mutually exclusive where animals can choose only one of them at given times. Extensive focus on sleep and feeding will make organisms vulnerable to predators while insufficient sleep and feeding will also lead to premature death. Therefore, a tight regulation between these two behaviors is critical for organisms' survival. Yet, the relationship between them is not fully understood. One hypothesis proposes an opposing role for these two behaviors in which shortened sleep stimulates higher feeding and vice versa. However, this hypothesis has not been fully tested in animal models. Here, taking advantage of the Sleep Inbred Panel (SIP) lines of the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) artificially selected for long and short sleep phenotypes, we have tested the hypothesis. Using Drosophila Activity Monitor and Consumption-Excretion method, we quantified the sleep parameters (total sleep, bout numbers, bout lengths, etc) and food consumption of 37 short and long sleep SIP lines. Taken together, these findings give us a better insight into the relationship between food consumption and sleep.

Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) undergo post-transcriptional modifications at or near the anticodon loop and are necessary for protein synthesis. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Trm7 is required for 2′-O-methylation of tRNA and requires interaction with Trm732 and Trm734 for modifications at positions 32 and 34, respectively. The Trm7, Trm732, and Trm734 proteins are widely conserved in numerous eukaryotes, indicating that Trm7 proteins may universally require binding partners for methyltransferase activity. In humans, mutations in FTSJ1, a Trm7 ortholog, can cause nonsyndromic X-linked intellectual disability. The particular Trm7 residues associated with Trm732 or Trm734 binding are still unknown. To identify these residues, sequences of evolutionarily diverse Trm7 homologs were compared to identify possible regions required for binding to Trm732 and Trm734. Candidate residues were modeled on the Trm7:Trm734 crystal structure to identify possible interactions. Trm7 variants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis, and a yeast growth assay was conducted to analyze the selected Trm7 amino acid variants. Through a series of yeast mutants that required Trm7 interaction with Trm732 or Trm734 for proper growth, we have identified Trm7 residues required for both Trm732 and Trm734 binding interactions. Through this study, understanding how these proteins interact will later facilitate the study of conserved homologs in humans.

During early stages of vertebrate development, embryonic cells differentiate to form adult tissues and organs. These cells use various genetic signaling pathways to guide their development. Our study is focused on the Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling pathway, which is known to be important for the development of the pharynx, an embryonic structure that gives rise to craniofacial features, the thymus and parathyroid glands. We used Xenopus laevis as our model organism and performed a microarray to identify novel targets of the FGF pathway in the developing pharynx. We hypothesized that targets of the FGF signaling pathway may play important roles in the development of the pharynx and its derivatives. Among the possible FGF targets identified by the microarray were two members of the Iroquois family of transcription factors. We analyzed the expression patterns of the Iroquois family in Xenopus embryos with in-situ hybridization found that several are expressed in the developing pharynx. We inhibited Iroquois translation by injecting Xenopus embryos with morpholinos and analyzed these Iroquois loss-of-function embryos with in-situ hybridization to visualize pharyngeal gene expression, finding some changes. We also analyzed Iroquois loss-of-function tadpoles with skeletal preparations and found defects in their craniofacial features compared to sibling control embryos. Overall, we have begun to characterize the Iroquois genes as possible FGF pathway targets in the developing pharynx. The more we learn about the genetic signaling cascades guiding embryonic development, the more we can understand why certain birth defects occur.

Earthworms are emerging as a model for the study of action potentials in the teaching laboratory. The position and the superficial nature of the median giant nerve fiber in the ventral nerve cord of the common earthworm may provide a lost cost, high success rate model for action potential investigations. Our project goal was to develop a procedure that would allow the recording and measurement of action potentials in earthworms. We utilized the iWorx system to measure these action potentials. Earthworms were anesthetized in a 10% ethanol solution for 5 minutes and placed in a nerve bath chamber. Our results indicate that the earthworm is a viable, cost-effective alternative to other animal models in the undergraduate physiology laboratory study of action potentials.

KCNE3 is a single transmembrane accessory protein that modulates the voltage-gated potassium ion channel, KCNQ1. KCNE3 is expressed in the colon, small intestine, specific types of cells in the stomach, and all regions of the human heart. Hereditary mutations on this protein are linked to several diseases like Long-QT syndrome, Atrial fibrillation, Manière's disease, etc. Information on this protein is limited, but the potential association with disease amplifies the importance of studying the properties of this transmembrane protein. So far, some studies have been done in micelles and isotropic bicelles, giving us insight into its function. However, these studies have not been performed in their native membrane environments which implies the potential for limited characterization. This study seeks to probe structural and dynamic properties of KCNE3 in its native environment. It also seeks to compare the backbone fluctuation of different sections of KCNE3 in lipid bilayers through route mean square deviation (RMSD) within the transmembrane domain and the extracellular domain of KCNE3. To achieve this, we have optimized sample preparation for successful overexpression, purification, MTSL spin labeling, and incorporation of KCNE3 into POPC/POPG liposomes and performed CW-EPR experiments. Our initial CW-EPR spectral line shape analysis and molecular dynamics simulation data suggest slower motion of the protein in a lipid bilayer environment when compared to micelles. It also suggested that the spin label sidechain motion of transmembrane domain of KCNE3 is restricted when compared to that in extracellular region of KCNE3 which is consistent with previous structural studies.

Neurite degeneration is a cellular dysfunction commonly associated with neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (PD). One common method of scoring neurite degeneration in micrographs involves calculation of a degeneration index (DI) using neurite fragment measurements obtained via the particle analyzer plugin of FIJI software. However, this method can be time consuming and subject to inaccuracies related to inadequate contrast. Here we describe a modified method for performing DI measurements with enhanced efficiency, accessibility, and accuracy compared to existing techniques. We developed a macro to automate the analysis process, enabling rapid and objective measurements of multiple images. We have also increased the accuracy of measurements by modifying selection criteria for neurite fragments, as well as by determining optimal procedures for contrast enhancement and removal of non-neurite materials from images. Moreover, we demonstrate how this method may be applied to measure neurite degeneration in an in vitro model of PD. To model neurite degeneration associated with PD, we treated Lund Human Mesencephalic (LUHMES) cells with 4-hydroxynonenal or 6-hydroxydopamine, compounds that induce oxidative stress. We describe culture methods, cell densities, and drug concentrations that yield consistent and accurate measurements of neurite degeneration, and we demonstrate use of our optimized method in an experiment assessing the effects of c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) on neurite degeneration. Since neurite degeneration is a key, early-stage event associated with PD, this optimized and automated method may be used to gain novel insights into molecular interactions underlying PD progression.

The principal goal of this project is to develop a genetic transformation system in Phyllostachys bambusoides (bamboo) and utilize it as a non-human model to better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of non-neuronal acetylcholine expression and its effect on cellular and developmental processes. Specifically, the bamboo transformation system is being utilized to genetically alter the expression of cloned genes of the acetylcholine pathway coding for choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) and acetyl choline esterase (AChE). The presence of non-neuronal acetylcholine in plants and animals has been implicated in the regulation of cell differentiation, phyotochrome-mediated processes, cytoskeletal organization, immune function, and ion transport. The presence of acetylcholine in bamboo shoots at a significant concentration of 2.9 µmol/g presents a unique potential to examine bamboo as a non-human model system to decipher the molecular events of the non-neuronal acetylcholine pathway. Altering the expression of the ChAT and AChE genes in transgenic bamboo will provide valuable insights in the role of acetylcholine in non-neuronal phenomena involving cell gene expression, proliferation, differentiation and organization. This will in turn illuminate our understanding of the non-neuronal acetylcholine's role in pathogenesis of diseases such as acute and chronic inflammation, local and systemic infection, dementia, atherosclerosis and cancer. An Agrobacterium-mediated bamboo genetic transformation system was developed with a GFP construct along with an environmental-friendly non-antibiotic phosphomannose isomerase (pmi) selection system. The bamboo transformation system will be utilized to over express the ChAT gene and partially silence the AChE gene. The transgenic plants will be analyzed for the altered concentrations of acetylcholine to establish the effectiveness of the bamboo genetic transformation model to characterize the molecular phenomena behind the non-neuronal acetylcholine system that may suggest molecular therapeutic targets.

The broad objective of this research is to improve the specificity, selectivity and reliability of the analytical methods used to identify three regioisomeric aromatase inhibitors; 5-alpha-Androstan-17-one, 5-alpha-Androst-16-en-3?-ol and 17-beta-Hydroxy-5-alpha-androst-2-ene. A combination of chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques namely, HPLC, GC-MS, and FT-IR, will be used to generate the analytical profiles of the three regioisomeric drugs in addition to discriminating among them. In addition, this project is aiming to improve chromatographic resolution between the three studies compounds to provide additional layer of discrimination when the mass spectra are nearly identical.

Estrogen hormones are commonly found in surface waters as harmful pollutants. Fluorescence can be used to detect these pollutants and photolysis can be used to treat them. Photolysis may reduce the harmful effects of the estrogens by breaking them down. In order to better understand the breakdown of estrone into its photolysis product lumiestrone, the structures and excited states in several solvents were analyzed with Gaussian; absorption and fluorescence energies were also computed. Experimental solvent trends were reproduced and the stabilization of the first excited state points to possible reasons for the different photolysis behavior of the molecules. Lumiestrone had lower energy structures compared to estrone. Results varied based on the presence, hydrogen bonding ability, and polarity of the solvent.

Adolescent and adult students in high schools and colleges are among the most vulnerable population to substance use. Precognition of the crowd would enable event planners, risk managers, and emergency medical service personnel to evaluate the spectator behavior and mitigate the potential risk associated with the mass gatherings. In this study, thirty-three illicit and prescribed psychotic drug residues and five new psychoactive substances were quantified in wastewater, using state-of-art ultra-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry, discharged during a college and a high school basketball games that were played in the same stadium in Kentucky. The concentration of cocaine, hydrocodone, and gabapentin in discharged wastewater was significantly higher (p ≤ 0.006) in a college basketball game whereas that of amphetamine, methylphenidate, hydromorphone was significantly higher (p ≤ 0.040) during a high school basketball game. Interestingly, the ratio of cocaine to its metabolite in wastewater was found higher than predicted by the human excretion profile, suggesting that a significant amount of cocaine may have directly discharged down the drain during the college basketball game. Moreover, five unregulated substances that mimic the effects of controlled neuropsychiatric and illicit drugs, including methcathinone and mCPP were also quantified in wastewater indicate the prevalence of new psychoactive substances in Kentucky. This is the first report of quantified substances of potential abuses at basketball games.

Saffron (Crocus sativa L.), is a high-value medicinal and culinary plant that produces the most expensive spice in the world. Due to its low per kilogram yield, fastidious cultivation and post-harvest requirements, and very high economic value, saffron is subject to adulteration to enhance its color and flavor. Spectrophotometric and chromatographic techniques have been tested to separate and identify the composition of saffron. Few studies have reported use of high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) for qualitative and quantitative analysis of saffron and its major compounds safranal, picrocrocin and crocin. The objective of this study is to obtain a comprehensive fingerprint profile of saffron cultivated across the world using HPTLC. Ethanolic extracts of commercially available saffron samples were spotted on pre-coated silica gel HPTLC plates and developed using a 2-propanol, ethyl acetate, water (13:5:2 v/v/v) solvent system and scanned at 254 nm and 310 nm. Peaks and Rf values were obtained using CAMAG vision CATS software (CAMAG, Switzerland). The HPTLC fingerprints for each of the nine samples were recorded and are presented. Studies using HPTLC to quantify active ingredients in saffron, such as safranal, picrocrocin and crocin, are ongoing.

Antibiotics are used for therapeutic and growth-promoting purposes in farm animals. For example, swine, cultivated for food, ingests antibiotics such as tetracycline, macrolides and sulfonamides. The most common route of administration of antibiotics is oral through animal feed. Unabsorbed antibiotics in the gastrointestinal tract of swine and antibiotics metabolites are passed through animal waste, which results in significant concentrations of antibiotics in manure and thus jeopardizes its use as a land fertilizer. It is believed that this input of antibiotics into the environment contributes to the propagation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Therefore, the antibiotics should be removed from manure before land application. There are various methods for reducing the concentration of antibiotics in manure. Lagoons and anaerobic digestion are the most common methods of manure management. To assess the efficiency of these methods, manures need to be initially analyzed for their antibiotic contents. In this study, we have performed Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) to extract antibiotics from swine manure. An LC-MS method to measure the concentration of tetracycline, tylosin and sulfonamethoxazole in these extracts will be presented.

Ignitable liquids (ILs) are used as accelerants to burn items at a faster rate and the presence of an IL indicates that arson has occurred. Upon arrival to an arson scene, fire investigators access the scene and collect substrates containing ILs. The substrates, such as concrete and wood, are removed from the scene by methods that are time consuming, and require heavy machinery and tools. The evidence is transported in air-tight containers to the laboratory where analysts identify the chemical classification of the IL using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS).

In this work, readily available absorbent household materials such as microfiber and paper-based products have shown to be effective in the collection of ILs from non-porous surfaces such as ceramic tile. Fibers from these materials are attached to a solid backing which ensures the removal of the fibers from the pores containing the IL. Ten materials of varying chemical compositions were taken through several validation analyses to determine the presence of interferences and to evaluate absorption and collection capabilities. While these materials were able to recover an IL efficiently from a non-porous surface, recovery from a porous concrete surface was significantly lower. To optimize collection several aspects such as the texture of the surface and of the lifting material will have been considered and will be described in this presentation. The use of an absorbent lifting material to recover ILs will offer a simplified and improved collection and recovery process for a suspected IL present at an arson scene.

A novel fluorescent [2, 2!-bipyridine]3-hydroxamate-Ru (II) complex (10) was prepared in which glycine acts as a spacer in between ruthenium and hydroxamate metallo-receptor. The identity of the complex has been confirmed by spectroscopic methods. The new complex has been evaluated for its photoluminescence properties. The results showed that 10 is capable of sensing H+, Cu2+ and Ni2+ ions as evidenced by strong quenching of fluorescence. Further studies suggested that the quenching of fluorescence of the new ruthenium complex occurs predominantly by means of an electron transfer mechanism. The binding of 10 with cations resulted in a gradual quenching of fluorescence in the case of Cu (II) or a fast quenching in the case of Ni (II) ions, suggesting electron transformation between two metal centers. Further examination of quenching models revealed that the Stern-Volmer dynamic quenching model was obeyed in case of Ni (II), an intermolecular quenching and Perrin model of static quenching was obeyed in the case of Cu (II), an intramolecular quenching. Non-fluorescent analytes such as Cu (II) or Ni (II) can be quantitatively determined by measuring their ability to quench the florescence of Ru (II) complex.

Endocrine Disrupting (ED) substances contaminating the environment is a present-day public health concern. Steroids, a class of ED hormones, have been drawing the attention of researchers across the world due to their detrimental effects on various species of aquatic animals and humans. Endogenous steroidal estrogens, such as estrone and 17β-estradiol found in very low concentrations in the environment, can affect the hormonal balance of various fish species, thus posing a significant concern. Male fish species exposed to estrogens in nanogram concentration showed a high incidence of intersexuality and feminization. In humans, exposure to these hormones are known to cause infertility and cancer.

Farmers routinely administer supplements and growth promotors containing synthetic and natural hormones to beef cattle to improve production efficiency. As a result of these feeding operations, steroidal hormones have been detected in runoff, soil and manure samples. These steroidal hormones enter the environment when cattle waste is applied to agricultural lands as manure. Hence it is important to analyze the potential risk of applying cattle waste directly from the storage systems of the feeding operations to the farming lands. During anaerobic digestion (a farm animal waste treatment process), free estrogens undergo microbial degradation to their conjugated forms, which are more mobile and persistent in the environment. Our research is focused on estimating the concentration of free and conjugated estrone and 17β-estradiol estrogens in anaerobically digested cattle waste using liquid and gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric techniques. Data gained from this research will be used towards studying the occurrence, degradation and transportation of these hormones from the waste disposal systems to the environment. The outcome of this study will also assist in regulating disposal and waste management practices. The design of a standard method used to study the fate of these estrogens before and after anaerobic digestion of waste along with the preliminary results will be presented.

Arson is a crime that involves the intentional setting of a fire for the destruction of property. The intentionality of this crime is often defined by the presence of an ignitable liquid at the crime scene that accelerates the rate of combustion or extent of damage. The first step in identification of ignitable liquid residues (ILRs) is to collect the residues from porous or semi porous materials such as wood, carpet, fabrics or concrete. At a crime scene, traditional collection of these substrates is accomplished by bringing large chunks of the material back to the laboratory for analysis. This is a time-consuming and laborious process. To improve the process, we propose using hand-held absorbent materials to collect the residues at the scene.

A variety of readily available household absorbent materials were analyzed to determine their collection efficiency of ILRs for both nonporous ceramic tiles and porous concrete samples. Examination of each material included both physical characteristics (surface texture, fiber size, etc.) through microscopic examination and chemical composition determined by FTIR analysis. This presentation explores the relationships (or lack thereof) between the texture and composition of the material with the material's ability to adequately recover ILRs from each surface type.

Useful in industry and necessary for life, the oxidation of organic molecules drives both the existence of most living organisms and much of the modern chemical industry. Biomimetic catalysts inspired by Cytochrome P450, one of nature's most effective agents of oxidation, have been synthesized with the novel addition of a light-harvesting antennae. Attached to the porphyrin macrocycle are the light-harvesting elements consisting of a boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) ligand, a photo-stable dye designed to act as an antenna absorbing a broad spectrum of visible light between 450 to 550 nanometers to transfer to the central metal atom to increasing the catalytic activity. Preliminary oxidation studies have been conducted using various organic substrates to determine the extent of the increased catalytic efficiency.

In Nature, Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) catalyze a vast amount of oxidation reactions which has inspired the use of synthetic metal complexes as biomimetic catalysts. Following well documented procedures, several porphyrinoid (porphyrin and phthalocyanine) ligands containing different substituents were synthesized. The key structural differences as well as the advantages and disadvantages of each of the porphyrin and phthalocyanine ligands will be discussed further in the presentation. Metals of iron, manganese, and ruthenium were inserted into the various porphyrinoid ligands. The resulting metal complexes were characterized by 1H-NMR and UV-Vis spectroscopies, as well as IR spectroscopy for the metallophthalocyanine complexes. The catalytic ability of the metal complexes were evaluated in hydrocarbon and sulfide oxidation using PhI(OAc)2 and 2,6-Cl2PyNO as mild oxygen sources. High conversions and excellent chemoselectivity without overoxidation of sulfoxides into sulfones were obtained with various substrates. Of note, visible light irradiation was found to promote the ruthenium porphyrinoid-catalyzed oxidation in a significant way, which will be discussed in the presentation.

Radionuclide therapies have become valuable tools for cancer therapy and imaging. One of the more promising cores for use in radiotherapeutics is the fac-99mTc(CO)3 coordination-complex, this as a result of its ideal gamma wave emission and simple coordination chemistry. Rhenium, the next element down in group 7, is frequently used as a stand in for research into potential stable 99mTc complexes due to its radioactivity and relative expense. Several methods exist for ligating group seven tricarbonyl cores to organic molecules; however, few show high fidelity to single isomers and resilience to reactive amino acid residues. Additional challenges are associated with the delicate hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity balance that must be achieved for radionuclide-complexed organic molecules to reach target tissues and to be excreted in safe timeframes. Development of a small symmetrical triamine tridentate ligation system has shown promise in addressing the aforementioned challenges associated with 99mTc conjugation. Of specific importance is the modularity of the central region of this dien-ligation complex. Addition of small peptides and coumarinoid fluorophores has been achieved with relative ease, in respectable yields, using peptide synthesis techniques that are readily available. Targeting molecule addition to the central amide of the dien-ligand backbone may result in rapid development of highly targeted gamma ray emission tumor imaging agents that are both less toxic than modern radio-therapies, and more capable of imaging ever-smaller neoplastic clusters.

The purpose of this work is to develop a method to synthesize annulene-o,m,o,m-oxacalix[4]arene hybrids. These molecules are expected to adopt a conformation where the annulenes are in a close, cofacial orientation, resembling a tweezer. Once prepared, these hybrids will provide insights into the interactions between cofacial aromatic and antiaromatic systems. To develop the methodology for the synthesis of these annulene-oxacalixarene hybrids, a series p-substituted phenylethynyl-o,m,o,m-oxacalix[4]arenes is being prepared. The substituents range from strongly electron withdrawing to strongly electron donating, allowing a systematic study of the electronic nature of the phenylethynyloxacalixarenes and providing experience on how to synthesize and purify annulene compounds. This poster will discuss our progress in the preparation of the phyenyethynyloxacalixarene series.

Adding alkoxymethyl furfurals to diesel fuels decreases polluting exhaust emissions. In keeping with the tenets of green chemistry, the conversion of raw furfural to this acetalized form should use catalysts which are recyclable. Tin (II) chloride has proven to be an extremely efficient catalyst for this process; however, the process of recycling it requires distilling, extracting thrice, and evaporation. Therefore, Tin 2+ ions were incorporated into a water-insoluble metal organic framework (MOF) partnered with trimesic acid (TMA) as an organic ligand. Not only does a MOF make recycling easy, it may have additional catalytic properties. The resulting MOF was studied for its effectiveness and efficiency of catalyzing the conversion of pure furfural to furfural diethyl acetal in the presence of excess alcohol. In this presentation, we will demonstrate the catalytic properties of the MOF during this reaction and its recyclability afterwards.

In biomimetic catalysis, numerous transition metal complexes, including metalloporphyrin and metallosalens, have been synthesized to mirror the oxidative capability of heme-containing enzymes found in Nature. Most notably, cytochrome P450 enzymes bearing an iron protoporphyrin IX active site can efficiently construct oxidized compounds with remarkably high regio- and stereoselectivity. The principle oxidants in transition metal-catalyzed reactions are high-valent metal oxo species that can transfer their oxo ligands to an organic reductant in a process referred to as oxygen atom transfer (OAT). In this presentation, a chemical pathway using iodobenzene diacetate was deployed to generate reactive manganese(IV)-oxo and chromium(V)-oxo intermediates, i.e. [MnIV(Por)O] (Por = porphyrin) and [CrV(salen)O] (salen = N, N′-bis(salicylidene)ethylenediamine). By expanding a promising photochemical approach, the same [MnIV(Por)O] and [CrV(salen)O] transients were also formed allowing for direct kinetic studies of oxidation reactions in real-time with impressive temporal resolution. Comprehensive kinetic studies of OAT reactions through chemically generated metal-oxo intermediates were conducted, illuminating mechanistic interpretations of the oxidation routes where physical intermediates are not spectroscopically detectable.

Carbonic anhydrase is a family of enzymes that catalyze the interconversion between carbon dioxide and water and the dissociated ions of carbonic acid. The purpose of this research project is to synthesize metal-histidine frameworks mimicking carbonic anhydrase. The development of new materials mimicking Carbonic anhydrase is important to control the atmospheric carbon dioxide level and help to reduce the effect of global warming. We report the synthesis of a new zinc-histidine framework by using zinc nitrate and L-histidine as starting materials. The new framework material was characterized using powder X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and Infrared spectroscopy. Its catalytic activities were studied by the self-decomposition of para-nitrophenyl acetate, a reaction that is commonly used to evaluate the catalytic properties of carbonic anhydrase. The result showed the material has a larger absorbance in comparison to blank samples.

In 2020, it is projected that 1 in 2 men and 1 in 3 women will receive a new cancer diagnosis, resulting in 1.8 million new cases of cancer in the United States alone. Although the mortality rate of cancer has been declining since 1991, there is still progress to be made. Our goal is to continue this declining trend by investigating new, targeted diagnostic imaging compounds for earlier and more rapid detection of diseased states. Given the widespread use of technetium- 99m (99mTc) in over 70% of radiopharmaceutical compounds, it is an ideal candidate for generating medically relevant organometallic complexes. The [99mTc(CO)3L]+ core, when chelated to facially coordinated tridentate ligands, shows superior pharmacokinetics and stability. Given 99mTc nuclear character, studying these complexes is complicated. Thus, the purpose of this research is to use non- radioactive rhenium (Re) in [Re(CO)3L]+ analogues to serve as safer models for 99mTc complexes. Furthermore, complexes that possess the core [Re186/188(CO)3L]+ have shown their own promise in both medical diagnostic imaging and targeted cancer treatment. In this study we synthesized the facially coordinated tridentate ligand N-benzyl-2-(bis(2-aminoethyl)amino)acetamide and chelated it to ReI. Results on the synthesis of this complex will be discussed.

Organic water pollutants are difficult to remove from water supplies using standard water treatment methods like filtration. As a result, less conventional methods of water treatment are required for dealing with organic pollutants. One method that has been proposed is the use of photocatalysts to increase the rate at which the pollutants break down into less harmful forms. Photocatalysts like titanium dioxide have already been shown to be successful at this. However, photocatalysts tend to form suspensions when added to water, making them nearly as difficult to remove as the pollutants themselves. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) beads address this issue by acting as a large, buoyant substrate for the photocatalysts that can easily be filtered out of the water.

To ensure that the PDMS beads would work for this purpose, their ability to incorporate several different photocatalysts (TiO2, WO3, and ZnO) was tested. All of the photocatalyst were successfully incorporated, and this was confirmed using both Raman spectroscopy and Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy. The photocatalytic ability of the beads was also tested by using UV-Vis Spectroscopy with methylene blue. The PDMS beads with photocatalysts were shown to be effective at increasing the rate of degradation for methylene blue over photolysis alone. Additionally, the surface morphology and surface-area-to-volume ratios of the beads were observed using Scanning Electron Microscopy and Brunauer-Emmet-Teller isotherms to ensure that the beads all had comparable structures.

It is believed that PDMS beads are effective as a substrate for photocatalysts to facilitate the breakdown of organic pollutants.

Chemical publications contain a great deal of useful information, ranging from the minute details of a synthetic procedure to physical characterization data that can be mined to allow for machine-aided chemical design. However, this information can be difficult to machine read as scientific publications are most often found in portable document format (PDF), which can be difficult to parse. Additionally, scientific vocabulary can often be ambiguous. Here we are interested in developing a protocol to extract information about molecular structures and crystal syntheses (e.g., the solvent used to recrystallize the material). The protocol developed demonstrates core solutions and challenges in scraping data from the web and processing unstructured data obtained from scientific literature. The protocol developed here can be readily generalized to different topics in chemistry, and other disciplines, and has been implemented to further extract spectroscopic characterization data.

Topographic maps are used by a variety of disciplines that require detailed information about the features of the Earth's surface. These maps are traditionally created by surveyors in the field by measuring sets of points throughout a coverage area. These measurements are then converted into a topographic map representing the terrain by the use of contour lines. The focus of this research is to reduce the cost and time efforts for surveying land to generate topographic maps. We introduce an approach for developing a low-cost autonomous quad-copter UAV that uses LiDAR and CMOS image (camera) data to perform coverage area surveying to generate topographic maps. The terrain data acquired by our approach is post-processed on a dedicated server that displays the layered topographic map to the user in a web browser.

Big data and machine learning are being used together to further advance cybersecurity by making it possible to find trends in data to assess what is “normal” and what is not. The reason that big data is important for this process is that it allows for larger quantities of data to be evaluated and the larger the quantity of data, the more accurate the patterns will be. This, in turn, increases the efficiency and usefulness of the cybersecurity parameters that businesses and individuals will implement to secure their work. Sisense and Couchbase are two programs that make it easy to analyze big data and create analytic apps. They help to understand data with visual statistics that are then used to identify patterns.

Magnaporthe oryzae is a devastating fungal pathogen that infects over 50 species of grasses including major crops such as rice, wheat, oats, and barley. Some strains of M. oryzae due to the presence of Magnaporthe oryzae Telomere Retrotransposons (MoTeRs) have highly dynamic subtelomeres, even in the progeny of a single parent. Although MoTeR elements are endemic to the telomere, truncated MoTeRs (MoTeR relics) exist in the genome interior that are possible markers for sequences that were once telomeric in nature. The objective of this study was to investigate how MoTeR relics come to reside in the interior of the genome and whether they differ in related strains. Local blastn analyses and genome visualizations using IGV revealed that the relics in two Lolium pathotype strains, whose genomes should be nearly identical, were variable and that their flanking sequences revealed genome rearrangements in the form of sequence duplications. MoTeRs facilitate rearrangements both at chromosome ends and in the interior of the genome facilitating genome evolution in this global pathogen.

Ethical hacking improves cyber security by deciphering many of the encryption methods we use to protect our important data such as usernames, passwords, and credit card information. John the Ripper, password cracking software tool, is used to help understand some potential vulnerabilities our systems holding private information that would be devastating if obtained by the wrong hands, such as black hat hackers who would want to use this data unlawfully. This allows ethical hacking to further improve our data's security everyday by understanding the vulnerabilities that our password hashes may have from John the Ripper. Due to advancements in technology and software, this puts even more private information that needs to be secured and unobtainable by potential threats.

Lunar IceCube is a 6U cubesat that will launch on the maiden voyage of Artemis 1 as just one of thirteen specially selected secondary payloads. Lunar IceCube will spend nearly a year travelling to the Moon to eventually come to a low altitude orbit to search for water-ice and other valuable volatiles. It will do so by utilizing a state-of-the-art infrared point spectrometer, the Broadband InfraRed Compact High Resolution Exploration Spectrometer (BIRCHES). This presentation will describe the process of building a level 1 data processing pipeline for BIRCHES and the specific challenges associated with interplanetary data science missions. Also presented is information on how this level 1 Python script fits into a larger data processing pipeline. Finally, the logistic impacts that COVID-19 has had on the project from a programming point of view will be discussed.

In this research, I dove into the nature of PRNGs and explored more deeply how they work and actually generate random numbers. I then made my own PRNG, though it is a bad PRNG it is somewhat random. To check this, I performed some known tests on the PRNGs and I further explain how machine learning could be used as a technique to test its randomness. Combined with another known good PRNG, like Java's Math.random, the ML algorithm will use supervised learning to try to determine which PRNG created a given random number and depending on how many correct guesses, the PRNG will be considered good or bad.

Magnaporthe oryzae is a pathogenic fungus responsible for rice blast disease. The terminal ends of M. oryzae chromosomes are unstable which allows for frequent rearrangement of the genome, a property that may be useful for adaptation. High-quality genome assemblies are required to investigate this mechanism. The genomes of M. oryzae strains Guy11 and U233 were selected for improvement with the goal of producing chromosome-level assemblies. Using MUMplot, the Guy11 and U233 contigs were aligned to two chromosome-level assemblies of M. oryzae strains (70-15 and LpKY97). The MUMplot data guided efforts to arrange and connect contigs, find mis-assemblies, and identify translocations. MinION raw reads of the Guy11 and U233 assemblies were used to verify MUMplot data. Raw read coverage was viewed in the Integrative Genomics Viewer, and BLAST reports gave information on connections. The subterminal regions of strain 70-15 were also used to guide the arrangement of Guy11 contigs, as these regions of 70-15 have been characterized, and 70-15 is a progeny strain of Guy11.

The final number of Guy11 contigs was reduced from 33 to 23, and the number of U233 contigs was reduced from 49 to 43. In both genomes, mis-assemblies were found and corrected, and Escherichia coli DNA contamination was discovered. U233 had seven translocations in its assembly, but none were present in Guy11. Identifying the telomere-containing contigs enables future study of the terminal and subterminal regions of the genomes. The refined genomes can be used for reference-based assembly using Illumina reads to further improve other genome sequences.

We discuss the initial solution for a database support for the Linguistic Atlas Project (LAP). The Linguistic Atlas Project (LAP), founded in 1929 at the behest of the American Dialect Society, is the most thorough and expansive study of American English undertaken to date. Despite this fantastic feat, most of the vast amount of data remains inaccessible to researchers and other data users in a convenient way. The data remains stored in a mix of CSV, Excel, and image files that are hard to navigate and have inconsistencies in how information is recorded. With better access, the door would open for the LAP to be used as a rich pool of data in broader research into American English dialects. The goal is to provide an efficient system to respond to complex queries in the context of the American dialects.

To complete this goal, I am using the programming language Python 3, along with some utility modules, such as Flask, to create a website and WTForms for handling complex online forms and queries. I am also using SQLite, which allows me to construct and query databases. Tying all of these components with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for added functionality and visual appeal will produce a useful and user-friendly searching system.

This project is a part of the KY Young Researchers program with Drs. Allison P. Burkette and Jerzy W. Jaromczyk as my research mentors. This research project is being conducted throughout my senior year of high school, having started the year prior.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are enzymes that degrade all kinds of extracellular matrix proteins during the wound-healing process. TIMP-1 is a tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (MMPs). In this work, we are investigating how MMPs and TIMPs, and the ratio of MMPs to TIMPs affect the wound surface area and the healing time. The data used for this work was of sixteen patients with diabetic foot ulcers in which measurements were taken of MMPs and TIMPs during a 12-week period. A multilinear regression analysis was performed on the interaction terms of different variables and compared to the wound surface area and compared to the regression analysis done on just the individual variables. It was concluded that the linear regression analysis done by the interaction terms was more beneficial to the wound surface area than the one done on individual variables.

Magnaporthe oryzae is an ascomycete fungus that is a major pathogen of numerous crops and grasses. Previous work has shown that certain strains of M. oryzae have remarkably unstable telomeres. The objective of the present study was to explore the effect of this instability on the integrity of chromosome ends in different M. oryzae populations. Sequence reads containing telomeric (CCCTAA) repeats were extracted from genomic datasets representing a global collection of 145 M. oryzae strains from 11 plant genera. Telomeric reads were assembled into telomeric mini-contigs containing the CCCTAA repeats and short stretches of adjacent sequence. Next, we used the software program SeqOthello to search the telomere junctions from each strain against the raw reads from all others. In total, over 1,148 telomere junctions were analyzed via manual interrogation, Unix command line, and pattern analysis and poor quality sequences, or contigs with internal telomere repeats were discarded. Among the 819 telomeric contigs retained for analysis, 42% contained a telomere junction that was unique to the strain in which was first identified. In contrast 57% of telomere junctions were shared among other strains, with some junctions being present in up to 10 strains. Finally, 1% of telomere repeats were joined to telomeric retrotransposon sequences and were, therefore, not informative with respect to junction conservation. With so many telomere junctions being unique to just a single fungal strain, and the others not showing wide conservation, this throws into question the presumed primary function of telomeres - namely end-protection.

There is a rapid proliferation of devices for monitoring brain signals. The purpose of this work is to develop a web-based software interface that: 1) is capable of filtering and visualizing EEG data, and 2) allows the user to experiment with and learn about the dynamics of the brain through the basic analysis of such data. We developed a web-based graphical interface using HTML and JavaScript. This interface allows easy access and operation through an up-to-date web browser with no software downloads necessary. The file player was tested on sample recordings made using the OpenBCI EEG system in which repeated eye closure at intervals of 10 seconds modulated the 8-13 Hz alpha rhythm of the EEG. As expected, the alpha power is suppressed when the eyes are open and elevated upon eye closure. The results of all analysis operations were confirmed by comparing the outputs against an analysis performed on Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA). The interface was found to reproduce recordings in real time with various filters. An informal focus group found the features to be intuitive and provided useful feedback time for further development. A software utility for analyzing and visualizing EEG recordings through a web browser was successfully developed and tested. This could be a useful educational tool for students, researchers, and hobbyists who lack the skills or access to specialized software to analyze their data and design or use interactive protocols.

Our goals with this project were to develop computational tools for identifying telomeric reads from raw reads and investigating these telomeres for potential de novo telomeres. Telomeres are repetitive sequences of nucleotides that occur at the chromosome ends of most eukaryotic organisms. The study of telomeres pertains to the organisms' evolution and adaptation, and the mechanisms of DNA replication. A particular fungus Magnaporthe oryzae has been studied extensively for its telomeric properties. The Magnaporthe oryzae genome has retrotransposon elements which often insert into telomeric regions, called MoTeRs. Additionally, some strains exhibit highly unstable chromosome ends. These mechanisms may result in the formation of newly formed telomeres, or de novo, telomeres.

The identification and classification of telomeric reads involves computational techniques. Two approaches were considered: exact matching, and a fuzzy sliding-window matching curated for identifying telomeric reads. After testing, it was determined that the fuzzy algorithm ran faster and found more telomeric reads than exact matching. We then clustered the telomeric reads based on telomere-adjacent regions. We found that we were able to identify all chromosome ends as individual clusters. We also found four potential de novo telomeres which did not cluster, but matched to the assembled genome. Three corresponded to MoTeR elements, and one matched in multiple places but did not correspond to any transposon elements.

In the future, we plan to apply this process to more genomes and collect more information on de novo telomeres as well as the properties of telomeric raw reads.

Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) is the use of virtual reality technology for psychological therapy, for example, the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The goal of exposure therapy is to help reduce a person's fear and anxiety, with the ultimate goal of eliminating avoidance behavior and improving quality of life. The types of events that result in combat-related PTSD cannot be reproduced in the clinical setting, thus Virtual Reality (VR) is used. It allows the presentation of traumatic events that cannot be recreated, allowing individuals to be in touch with traumatic cues that elicit arousal, and through repeated contact, decrease that arousal. Several studies have proven the effectiveness of VRET to treat combat-related PTSD and found group therapy to be even more effective. It was then suggested that the most effective therapy would involve a VR component which allows for multiple-patient interaction.

In order to create a single VR environment for multiple users, cloud computing technology was integrated into the software. A High-Level API (HLAPI) System was used to create a network between patients. HLAPI is a server authoritative system which allows one of the participants to be a client and the server at the same time, thus no dedicated server process is required. To host and develop the environment, Unity, a real-time development platform, was used. As a result, by integrating cloud computing technology, patients are able to interact within a single environment which increases the effectiveness of VRET combat-related PTSD treatment.

Across North America, habitat loss has led to declines in songbird populations, including Brown Thrashers (Toxostoma rufum), a common species in Kentucky. The objective of this study was to test the effects of land cover dominated by invasive shrubs on the home ranges and nesting locations of breeding Brown Thrashers. The study area, Taylor Fork Ecological Area in Madison County, KY, is dominated by shrub and early-successional habitat. By locating nests and tracking individuals throughout the breeding season, we sought to identify a preference between native and exotic plants and whether this impacted nesting success and home range use. Vegetation data were collected within 5-meter radius plots around each nest found and at random locations to compare habitat use with habitat availability. Of 15 nests, all were in invasive shrubs, even though native shrubs were available, and young fledged from 11 of 15 nests. Eight of 18 captured Brown Thrashers were fitted with radio transmitters for tracking. Home ranges were measured with kernel analysis at 80% and 45% contours using Program R. To determine home range vegetation composition, the home range contours were superimposed on a land cover classification using ArcMap. Despite the vegetation composition of home ranges being similar to that of the study area, Brown Thrashers were tracked more often to woody shrub land cover. Given this disproportionate use of woody shrub, we suggest it may be beneficial to some species to maintain some stands of exotic vegetation until native substrates are established through restoration.

Human-elephant conflict (HEC) is a major issue for human livelihoods and elephant conservation in areas where human settlements and elephant habitats overlap. These interactions harm both farmers, as crop raiding events compromise food security, and elephants as farmers may retaliate against elephants. Previous work conducted in the Kasigau Wildlife Corridor (KWC) of Kenya as part of our Elephants and Sustainable Agriculture in Kenya project collected data to evaluate various fences for deterring elephants from crop fields. I (SC) am monitoring abiotic and biotic factors in the KWC as part of my MSc thesis to produce an ecologically based prediction system of elephant presence that local farmers can use to supplement deterrent fencing. This system uses data on seasons, moon phase, and elephant foraging on trees. Crop raiding events were found to be higher during the late wet/early dry season, crescent moon phases and periods of high environmental stressors such as years containing El Niño weather anomalies. Years where elephants were foraging heavily on trees also had higher crop raiding events. The efficacy of new combinations of fence types were also tested. Deterrent fences consisting of two deterrents continued to be more effective at preventing elephant crop raiding than deterrent fences with only a single deterrent, as was found in earlier trials published on this project. The results of my study will benefit not only the farmers living in the KWC, but also provide others living in high HEC areas with improved strategies for coexisting with elephants.

Foraging organism have been widely demonstrated to select foraging sites based on both net energetic return and risk of death. Furthermore, this selection by foragers has frequently been demonstrated as a significant factor in altering habitat, such as increased algal biomass in areas avoided by foragers in aquatic systems. Additional studies have explored the direct interaction between net energetic return and risk of death, demonstrating increased risk tolerance with increased energetic returns in interactions between large predacious and small foraging creek chubs (Semotilus atromaculatus). Smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu, SMB) are commonly the top predators in native central Kentucky mid-size stream fish communities with Cyprinid species comprising much of the lower trophic levels. In the present study we will examine optimal foraging in a Cyprinid species (fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, FHM) in the presence of varying levels of forage. Briefly, a 1 m2 container will be constructed with a 0.2 m2 refuge (foraging FHM can enter but predacious SMB cannot) at one end. A single predacious SMB will be acclimated to the container before the introduction of 8 FHM. Varying amounts of bloodworms will be offered to the FHM in the container outside the refuge. The number of FHM outside the refuge will quantified once per thirty seconds for 20 minutes. These data should contribute to our understanding of trophic interactions of fish and expand our understanding of habitat selection in Cyprinid species.

Climate change is expected to negatively impact species worldwide, with species exhibiting varied ecological and evolutionary responses. Relatively sessile taxa, such as amphibians, will likely be precluded from large-scale migration in response to climate change, thus necessitating evolutionary and/or developmental responses “in place”. Phenotypic plasticity may assist in mitigating climate change effects under such circumstances by allowing populations to “track” changing climate with appropriate phenotypic responses. However, the abundant center distribution hypothesis predicts population density declines with increasing distance from the centers of species' geographic ranges, and similar hypotheses predict similar declines in genetic diversity. Small, geographically marginal populations may therefore exhibit reduced capacities for phenotypic plasticity in response to climate change, though this relationship has not been directly tested. To determine how geographically central and marginal populations respond to climate change via phenotypic plasticity, we utilized mesocosm approaches to monitor the growth and development of larval Jefferson salamanders (Ambystoma jeffersonianum (Green 1827)) under current, and predicted future, climate scenarios. While this study is ongoing, our results will have important conservation implications by quantifying potential geographic variation in the ability to adaptively respond to climate change and thus the need for phenotype- or locality-specific conservation strategies.

Mudskippers are intertidal fishes of the family Gobiidae with an amphibious lifestyle. They are territorial and exhibit behaviors to attract mates and defend against competitors. Recently, it has been shown that vibrations are produced and transmitted through the mud during behavioral displays in one species (Periopthalmodon septemradiatus). To see if vibrations are produced in other mudskipper species, we recorded behavior via digital video and vibrational signals via geophones of pairs of the mudskipper Periophthalmus barbarus. Twelve fishes varying in size and sex were used in this experiment. A resident fish was placed in an aquarium and allowed to claim territory for at least 3 days. Then an intruder was placed in a plastic mesh arena in the aquarium that allowed the two fishes to interact. 158 vibration signals were recorded and characterized as either pulse trains, tones, or grunts, with grunts being the most common. Tones and grunts were approximately half a second in duration, while pulse trains lasted longer (approximately 2 to 4 seconds). Mean peak frequencies in tones were lower (40-60 Hz) than those of grunts and pulse trains (60-80 Hz). In most of the trials, resident fishes produced many of the vibrations and outcompeted intruding fishes unless intruders were considerably larger fishes. While the mechanism of this vibration production is currently unknown, vibrational communication through the mud is an important mode of communication in mudskippers. It is likely that this form of communication is a modification of underwater sound production that is common in gobioid fishes.

A predictive component to conservation work is necessary when assessing the distribution of rare and uncommon species. Species distribution modeling software, such as Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), provide this component by delineating habitat suitable to a target species from presence-only data and applicable environmental parameters. This study used MaxEnt modeling to define areas of suitable habitat within the montane region of Maryland to determine where stonefly species listed as USGS Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SCGN) may be present. Models were tested by field sampling during the emergence periods for target SGCNs in riparian areas identified by MaxEnt as suitable habitat. These efforts have resulted in the identification of new populations of rare and uncommon stoneflies, including Allocapnia simmonsi Kondratieff & Voshell, 1981, a rare endemic to the Ridge and Valley region of the central Appalachians.

The Australian crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus) has become increasingly common in the aquaculture industry due to its larger size and tolerance of environmental conditions such as temperature, hypoxia, and water quality. There is a high risk of the species being introduced into the wild, as aquaculture ponds are commonly in association with natural streams and ponds. Likewise, public use, and disposal, of crustaceans is known to not be tightly controlled which could lead to competitive interactions with other widespread native species. Therefore, we are interested in examining the behavioral nature of C. quadricarinatus in the intraspecies pairing as well as interspecies pairing with a well-established model of an aggressive native crayfish (P. clarkii). To accomplish this, crayfish were isolated for 2 weeks and then paired for 20 min with video monitoring. Similar sized C. quadricarinatus were used for pairing from small (4-5 cm body length) to large (∼15 cm). Only large C. quadricarinatus and large P. clarkii were paired. Thus far, small C. quadricarinatus are more aggressive in their intraspecies pairings than either the large C. quadricarinatus or the P. clarkii. The results of this ongoing investigation will establish the social nature of the previously unstudied C. quadricarinatus.

Aquatic insect emergence is an important but understudied function of aquatic ecosystems, particularly restored wetland systems. This study measured aquatic insect emergence from two headwater valleys in eastern Kentucky with different hydrologic functions as a result of human impacts. One valley, Slabcamp, was restored to a multi-threaded channel/wetland complex. Beaver recolonized this valley in 2017 and as of March 2020 the beavers have constructed 7 dams. The other valley, Jones Branch, has experienced historical disturbance resulting in a channelized system with incised banks and lack of connection to the ground water. Floating emergence traps were placed over predominant channel habitats in each valley, and in predominant habitats of a beaver pond in the restored valley. Emergence traps were placed for one week every month beginning in May 2020. Insects from each trap were identified to morphospecies, counted, and measured to calculate biomass. Emergence data from May 2020 – August 2020 suggest a greater diversity and magnitude – in terms of abundance (individuals/m2) and biomass (mg/m2) – of emergent insects from habitats in the restored valley. Further, we found a greater magnitude and duration of emergence from the beaver ponds compared to the channel habitats of the restored valley. Diversity data suggests there was higher morphospecies richness from the restored valley during the study period. These preliminary results suggest restoring pre-colonial, hydrologic functions to headwater valleys can have beneficial impacts on emerging aquatic insects.

Lilley Cornett Woods (LCW) is one of the best examples of an old growth, mixed mesophytic forest left in Kentucky. The forest composition has been well-characterized since Bill Martin established plots in 1971 that have been surveyed every 10 years. While the forest has been protected from many anthropogenic disturbances, it is still vulnerable to invasive species such as hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA, Adelges tsugae). This study compares data collected in 1999 (pre-HWA invasion) and 2010 (post-HWA invasion) to data collected in May to August of 2020 to determine how HWA has affected the understory populations of the beech (Fagus grandifolia) and hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) communities at LCW. Eleven hemlock dominated plots and eighteen beech dominated plots were surveyed across two different areas of the forest. The data collected in each plot includes tree species identity and diameter at breast height, with the understory composed of all trees 2.5 cm dbh to 12.5 cm dbh. Importance values, species richness, and total density were calculated to show change over time. There was an overall decrease in species richness and total density in each community, as well as an increase in the importance values of beech within each community. The overall increase in importance values of beech shows that beech trees are becoming more dominant in the understory of both communities. Importance values from the two areas show that understory composition is changing more rapidly in one area of Shop Hollow, while the other surveyed understory (Whittaker) is staying more stable.

Microstegium vimineum, known as Japanese stiltgrass, is an invasive annual grass which creates monocultures in native forest areas, outcompetes native understory species, decreases diversity, and prevents the regeneration of native trees. Development of more successful management strategies for this species depends on understanding the factors contributing to its competitive success. Invasive plants often form novel associations with soil organisms, and in other systems arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) has been shown to facilitate establishment and spread of these plants. Microstegium is also known to form associations with AMF, but research has yet to demonstrate whether this association has a role in Microstegium invasion and dominance over native vegetation. We conducted a field survey in invaded and uninvaded habitats across six sites near Louisville, KY to evaluate the importance of AMF in Microstegium invasion relative to abiotic factors known to be important to success of this species (e.g., light and soil nutrients). We found no difference in AMF extraradical hyphal abundance between invaded and uninvaded habitats, nor in AMF root colonization in Microstegium across abiotic gradients, indicating little role for AMF in Microstegium spread. However, our results did show a relationship between AMF root colonization and Microstegium morphological traits, with an association to specific leaf area. This indicates that Microstegium may derive some benefit from the association with AMF, which could partly explain its competitive dominance in invaded sites.

Small mammals are critical to whatever ecosystem they inhabit due to several key factors, such as their consuming of plants, insects, and seeds (Barbour and Davis, 1974). Their role in food webs as primary consumer, by eating producers and serving as a food source for higher levels of the food web like raptors, or their roles in agriculture (Blair, 1940). Recently, strides have been made to prove the ecological value of the Boone Cliffs Nature Preserve, however, not much progress has been made in the way of small mammal data. Population survey data was collected over the course of two years using two 5x4 grids of Sherman live capture traps. The small mammal population at the Boone Cliffs State Nature Preserve was found to be not diverse (H' = 0.0) after only having found the White footed Mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) over the course of the study. In turn, other calculations were made with regards to the population makeup of P. leucopus including percentages male and female, percentages found to be hosts for invertebrate larvae, along with average weight and other demographic features. The data generated by this study hopes to serve as a baseline for further small mammal studies in the Boone Cliffs State Nature Preserve.

Reforestation presents opportunities for improving the ecological health of highly disturbed urban and peri-urban sites, especially by increasing wildlife habitat, storing carbon, increasing biodiversity, and improving water cycling. In this study, a twenty-year chronosequence of mostly riparian sites around Lexington, KY, reforested as part of the Reforest the Bluegrass program were surveyed to test for possible benefits of urban riparian reforestation for soil and water quality. Preliminary results suggest that older, more developed sites have higher soil carbon levels (e.g., 3.8-3.9% Carbon in sites 19 – 20 years old vs. 2.9% in a 1 year-old site), emphasizing the importance of urban riparian reforestation for carbon sequestration and soil health improvement. Preliminary water quality analyses show complex patterns across sites, but suggest that water quality may improve as streamwater passes through reforested reaches. For example, at one site, average conductivity was approximately 10% lower downstream of the reforested area than upstream. Similarly, two sites demonstrated significant reductions in nitrate levels. Overall, these results suggest that urban reforestation can provide important environmental benefits by way of improved soil health and water quality.

This project set out to conduct new research on how prairie restoration in Kentucky and Ohio affects milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) populations, thus impacting the population size of monarch butterflies. Previously restored prairies were monitored for milkweed manually through transect measurements as well as by aerial photographs taken by a drone. Data collected through each method was used to calculate milkweed population size and density, and the methods compared through statistical analysis to determine which of the two methods is more effective. Data analysis through Geographic Information Systems (GIS) currently suggests that use of drone photographs is appropriate for sampling, however further exploration is necessary. If successful, analysis through the drone method would allow for faster sampling of sites and the ability to closely monitor them over time.

Amphibians are essential to ecosystem function, and with roughly one third of all species facing extinction, it is important to understand the potential consequences of species losses and/or population declines for energy flow. Despite historical approaches to population ecology that consider all members of a species as functionally equivalent, recent studies indicate that individual body size significantly impacts an individual's ecosystem function, with larger individuals being disproportionately more important to energy flow. Larval salamanders of the genus Ambystoma often represent the dominant vertebrate predators in fishless pond ecosystems, and they exhibit ontogenetic shifts in density and prey choice wherein population densities decline over time while increasing in average body size. We therefore sought to assess: a) whether energy flow exhibits linear relationships with larval body size; and b) how contributions to energy flow compare among large and small individuals when accounting for relative densities of each size class in natural pond communities. Densities of larval Ambystoma opacum and A. maculatum were determined from field studies conducted in 2006-2008, and gut contents were extracted from individuals representing a wide range of body sizes. Ash-free dry mass (AFDM), a commonly used surrogate for “energy”, was determined for all larvae and regressed against body size and density-corrected estimates of larval biomass. Analyses are currently underway, and our results will characterize the importance of larval salamanders in energy flow in aquatic systems, as well as possibly highlight the unique value of large individuals in nutrient cycling.

Old-growth forests are characterized by high species diversity, little evidence of human disturbances, tree-fall gaps, and provide important habitat for organisms that specifically rely on a variety of these characteristics, such as many bird and insect species. The forest on the south-facing slope at Boone Cliffs Nature Preserve in Burlington, KY is considered a diverse old-growth mixed mesophytic forest (H' = 1.86 in 2019; 2.06 in 1997). Tree survey data of six plots (0.04 ha/plot) collected in 2019 were compared to data from a 1977 publication to test for changes in community composition and diversity. The forest remained similar (81% Bray and Curtis, 93.3 Jaccard's similarity) between the two years, while we saw increases in forest density (283 to 375 trees/ha) and basal area (21.6 to 28.9 m2/ha), suggesting both the recruitment and growth of established trees. Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) had the highest density of shrubs and saplings in size class 3 (DBH of 1.27-3.84 cm) at 241.7 trees/ha in 2019, but was not observed in 1997. A shade-tolerant species, Acer saccharum remained the dominant tree species over time, increasing in importance value [from 66.4 (1977) to 75.1 (2019)] while Quercus muhlengergii greatly decreased in importance [from 54.49 (1977) to 26.36 (2019)], possibly due to direct competition and increased shade and canopy closure. The invasion of L. maackii should be monitored to preserve species diversity at the Preserve - and shifts in the species composition could implicate important long term community trends.

The Miller Welch Central Kentucky Wildlife Management Area in Madison County, Kentucky, is 747.5 ha (1847 acres) with roughly 60% open land and 40% forested with scattered streams and ponds (Kentucky Department of Fish & Wildlife Resources). The Wildlife Management Area is a popular resource for shooting sports, hunting, hiking, bird dog training, and many other outdoor recreational activities. A vascular flora was conducted during 2019 and 2020 to document the plant biodiversity in the area. After being identified, mounted, databased, and imaged, all specimens will be deposited in the Ronald L. Jones Herbarium at Eastern Kentucky University. Much of the collecting in the 2020 year were targeted searches when compared to the 2019 collecting trips. In total, there were over 800 collections made during the two growing seasons and identification is still underway to generate a final species list and eventual publication of results.

Buttress roots are a formation that is common in tropical rainforests, often extensively and across species. However, some tree species in temperate areas can also buttress, albeit to a lesser extent. The goal of this research was to discover which species of trees buttress in the Cincinnati region, as well as the size of the buttresses, the relationship of buttressing trees with species found in tropical rainforests, and the potential factors that might influence buttressing. Buttress roots were found to be short in height but sometimes were long lengths. Most trees were larger and thus presumably older, and 26 species in the area were found to buttress. All surveyed buttressed trees that were in a clumped formation. The soil carbon content and C:N ratio were high around trees with buttressing. There was no relationship between soil phosphorus and buttressing. Soil moisture was between 21-32% but did not vary greatly between the two measurements. Soil texture was mostly a variation of loam. Further research would test the hypothesis of the amount of carbon surrounding the tree such as a thick organic matter layer influences the trees likeliness of buttressing their roots.

As the launch of the Artemis-1 mission and the maiden voyage of the most powerful rocket in NASA's history, the SLS (Space Launch System), approaches, the secondary payloads will need to continue development efforts for their launch and mission operations. Of these development efforts, one of the most important is the development of the ground system that the projects will be utilizing to communicate with, command, and track their satellites. For small satellites, especially missions that intend to operate in deep space, the cost and time associated with ground station development is usually beyond the budget and schedules they are permitted. This gap poses an extraordinary roadblock for many missions, but NASA has developed a number of tools and services to help bridge this gap. As one of the secondary payloads for the SLS and Artemis-1, Lunar IceCube (a MSU-led CubeSat mission to explore the distribution and physics of lunar water-ice and other volatiles) has utilized resources like the Advanced Multi-Mission Operating System (AMMOS) Instrument Toolkit (AIT) as well as the Space Link Extension (SLE) and the Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Network (DTN) in order to facilitate communications and operations for the satellite once it is launched. These tools all play vital roles in accommodating the long distance and the complex operations plan that the Lunar IceCube mission will face in order to achieve its scientific and mission goal. Using these resources, the Lunar IceCube team has developed and is continuing development on a ground data system to fit within L-IC's mission requirements.

Here we will examine the results of a finite element analysis (FEA) of the 6U Lunar IceCube satellite mechanical structure. Using this analysis, we will determine if the space frame and mechanical structures meet NASA requirements for structural integrity and force loading. Additionally, will determine how locked rail launch systems within the small satellite deployer (Planetary Systems Canisterized Deployer) utilized to stow and launch the secondary payloads boosted to Earth escape by NASA's new high capacity launch vehicle- the Space Launch System (SLS). SLS launch profiles will impact future missions and information gained from this analysis, in particular the ability of the structure to be optimized through mathematical analysis in such a way to satisfy both end-user specifications and launch provider safety parameters. Such analyses could have benefits for streamlining mission design and helping future CubeSat missions ensure mission success as these analyses are applicable to a variety of mission profiles.

New technologies such as 3D printing allow mimicking nature more accurately. The wonderful combination of multifunctional materials used in bone, cartilage, nacre and similar biomaterials lead to enhanced properties that are lifesaving. Since the 1891 flight of Otto Lilienthal, the German pioneer of aviation, who was inspired by the flight of birds to manufacture his bio mimicked gliders and wing flapping aircraft, to the modern airliners, man has benefitted from biomimetics in aviation. The growth of biomimicking technology has been significant to the degree that hundreds of books have been so far listed with the Library of Congress. These include books on biomimetics, biomimicry, bioinspiration, and bioengineering and discuss topics such as network and computing models inspired by biology, bio mimicked photosynthesis, microfluidics inspired by nature, smart materials and composites, and many more. Therefore, it follows that a source is needed that compiles much of this information into a simple, approachable format. Using over 140 sources from journals, books, and the Internet, the following gives an overview of biomimicry as applied to a variety of fields, from medicine to architecture. It can be learned that applying the patterns found in natural organisms to artificial structures can make them stronger, more dynamic, and more complex on a microscale. As technology grows, society can only hope to be able to manufacture products and materials that will completely mimic the wonders of those that occur naturally.

Integrating the electrical activities of the brain with electro-mechanical systems to develop mind-machines has become one of the most active research topics in the Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Robotics communities. In this research, we designed and implemented a mind-controlled prosthetic arm. A wireless Electroencephalography (EEG) system, EMOTIV brain-wear is deployed to read the human brain waves. A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is used to recognize trained thoughts and convert them to neurosignals, which are processed and used to control a robotic arm. This research can assist people with hand disabilities and arm amputations to control their prosthetic arm by their thoughts. It enhances their interactive experiences, and improves their engagement with their surroundings.

High-speed metal forming processes have been attracting increasing attention for their applicability in many industries. These processes allow the deformation of high-strength and low-density metals. Using these materials in the automobile industry, for instance, to form space frames and other body panels would lower the overall weight of the vehicle, making it more fuel-efficient, which in turn, will help the environment. With the increase in strength and the decrease in density comes the inevitable loss of formability. Because of this, classic forming methods such as stamping and hydroforming are not practical and safe when forming these in-demand metals. Due to this obstacle, more promising techniques such as electrohydraulic forming (EHF), are being explored. In this research, the Johnson-Cook material model and the Johnson-Cook damage model were used to investigate the effectiveness of EHF in deforming high-strength, low-density metals. Free-forming deformation and conical die-forming deformation were compared from a damage standpoint using ANSYS Finite Element Analysis software. In the simulation, a pressure was imposed on an aluminum 6061-t6 sheet metal to mimic the effect of electrodes deforming the metal in EHF. A user-defined probe was created to keep track of the damage at any given point on the sheet. Trends were noted, and in the end, die-forming was determined to be safer. In the free-forming simulation, significant damage was observed in the center of the sheet, while in the die-forming simulation, no fracture occurred.

Open burning, also referred to as backyard burning, is defined as the residential burning of household trash on the owner's property. Backyard burning is a common practice in many areas of the country due to lack of access to a nearby disposal site or residents not wanting to pay for waste collection services. Rural communities that have less access to waste disposal services are some of the highest contributors to open burning. While open burning may be common practice in many areas of the country, it is extremely harmful to the environment because the air emissions from the incineration are released into the atmosphere without treatment or filtration. Smoke from the burning waste can contain many harmful pollutants. Kentucky prohibits all forms of open burning with the exception of fires set for cooking, recreational or ceremonial purposes, small fires for heating purposes, and land clearing; however, all of these exceptions must use clean lumber and not produce excessive or unusual smoke (Title 401 KAR 63:005). Despite these ordinances, open burning violations continue to be a common occurrence. This study seeks to better understand what the contributing factors are to open burning violations in Kentucky. The data for this study include all open burning violations reported to the Kentucky Division for Air Quality (DAQ) in 2019. Additional measures will include socioeconomic factors, education, proximity to waste removal sites, urban or rural, and access to public municipal trash removal. Implications for policy will be discussed.

Lespedeza was introduced in the US to reduce soil erosion and its conservation quality was found to be exceptional. As a forage legume crop, it has many desirable attributes. It persists under a wide range of soil conditions including ravaged mine sites. In the present study, we are examining element and heavy metal accumulation potentials of Lespedeza growing on the Butler County landfill site. Landfill leachate is known to carry various amounts of dissolved organic matter, inorganic macro components (common cations and anions including sulfate, chloride, iron, aluminum, zinc and ammonia), heavy metals (Pb, Ni, Cu, Hg), and xenobiotic organic compounds but no study has been conducted on this specific site. Here we hypothesize that Lespedeza plants growing on such a site will accumulate a number of elements and heavy metals. The ICP-OES analysis of landfill soils shows high concentrations of Fe, Al, Ca, P and other elements. Root and shoot of harvested plants are being analyzed particularly for their accumulation potential of heavy metals. Scanning micrographs of plant samples are being examined for anatomical alterations. Photosynthetic effectiveness of plant specimens is being analyzed in situ via a Photosynthesis Efficiency Analyzer. In the end, we will identify the rhizospheric microbiome involved in nitrogen fixation using nitrogenase nifH gene amplification by PCR. All analyses will be statistically compared to a control site located at the WKU Upper Green River Biological Preserve.

Urbanization process reduces forest and agriculture land area and increases the impervious surface area (ISA). Impervious surface is the surface that prevents the infiltration of water into the soil, such as roads and rooftops. Land surface temperature (LST) is an important factor of urban heat island (UHI), and normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) value is an indicator of urban climate. These values can be used for the analysis of imperviousness of an area. This study was conducted to explore the values of 2018 LST, NDVI, and percent ISA of Louisville and Lexington, metropolitan cities in Kentucky, to compare urbanization in these cities. NDVI maps for both cities were derived in ArcMap, using raster calculator. Landsat 8 thermal infrared band 10 and 11 were used to calculate LST in ArcMap. Percent ISA was calculated by using 2016 national land cover dataset. A higher degree of urbanization was found in Louisville compared to Lexington. Furthermore, these parameters (LST, NDVI, and percent ISA) were analyzed at Census Block Group (CBG) level, using grouping analysis tool in ArcMap for both cities separately. This study suggests that Lexington and its suburb areas reveals a more systematic pattern of urbanization, whereas, in Louisville a more scattered pattern is observed in urbanization process.

Soil erosion is the natural process of displacement of the upper layer(s) of soil due to erosive agents (e.g. water, wind, ice, human activity, etc.). Globally, an estimated 24 petagrams (ã??10ã??ˆ15 grams) of fertile soil is lost due to soil erosion. The resultant land degradation from erosion has a direct effect on human health through agriculture, economics, and even climate change.

In this study, we selected the Marrowbone Creek-Russel Fork watershed in Pike County, Kentucky, to estimate the total soil loss in 2019. This estimation was calculated utilizing the empirically based mathematical model, the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE). The USLE is utilizes five parameters (a rainfall erosivity index, a soil erodibility, a slope, length of slope, crop management types, and a supporting conservation practice factors) to estimate annual soil loss in ton/ha/yr. With this research, results are reported in four maps, including a map detailing the estimated soil loss across the study site. The estimated soil loss of the study site was 309.91 ton/ha/yr. Ultimately, more study and research into the specificity and rigor of determining each factor is necessary to proceed further in this project.

Lonicera maackii, also known as Amur honeysuckle, is a fairly widespread invasive species that has overtaken many forests in recent years. Amur honeysuckle has been the subject of several studies meant to outline the consequences of its continued invasion of the northwestern United States, including but not limited to adverse effects on native wildlife, native plants, ecosystems, and communities. Determining the extent to which a fungal parasite affects this invasive honeysuckle is important to inform decisions about methods of population and damage control. In this experiment, several characteristics of honeysuckle shrubs, such as base diameter, base diameter at stump height, stem mass, etc. were compared to measurements such as number, area, and mass of blighted leaves to determine the extent of damage or lack thereof caused by honeysuckle leaf blight, specifically in terms of how the blight affects short and long shoots. Short shoots have an internodal distance of less than five centimeters and may be more well-defended against pathogens than long shoots. In the end, it was found that honeysuckle leaf blight targets long shoots, and that smaller shrubs are more susceptible to blight because they have a higher fraction of long shoots compared to large shrubs. Additionally, short shoots have higher leaf density and slightly higher mean specific leaf area than long shoots. Because of this affliction, which causes leaf death, smaller shrubs may die off at higher rates than large shrubs, but this remains to be studied.

Land use and land cover change alters various factors, including hydrology and environment. This leads to change in flow pattern due to temporal variation in discharge distribution and accelerates various negative consequences. The objective of the research is to explore the potential change in the hydrologic property (streamflow) in the Cumberland River at Williamsburg between 2001 and 2016, and the extent to which they are associated with the observed past land cover change. This study discusses the hydrological impact of land cover change on the Cumberland River at Williamsburg, Kentucky, by using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Two land cover scenarios for the year 2001 and 2016 were used to simulate the hydrology of the Cumberland River at Williamsburg. Land cover was classified into four classes: agriculture, urban, forest, and water. Evaluation of the impacts of land cover change on streamflow was done by comparing the average annual basin values of streamflow for each of the land cover scenarios. Preliminary results show that an increase in agricultural and urban areas lead to increase in surface runoff generation. The output of this paper provides a robust approach of evaluating the impact of land cover change on water resources such as streams and rivers. Understanding the impact of land cover change on the hydrological properties is important for water engineers, town planners, and local authorities to make better decisions in planning and management.

Although cost-effective cumulative sampling methods such as using bags of sediment have been demonstrated as potentially more informative than grab sampling (Nix et al., 1994), only limited research exists on methods for cumulative sampling of fecal indicator bacteria, correlations and profiling capabilities between these methods and grab sampling, or comparisons against periodic-sampling methods used to assess legal surface-water contact standards. This study reports the furthest advancement to-date in cost-effective cumulative sampling methodology using bagged particulate-matter, by development and use of a cumulative-sampler device containing diatomaceous earth (Celite 545; DE Sampler). DE Samplers were deployed to collect E.coli with practical use as a more limited-contact and cost-effective tool for future success-monitoring of an urban stream planned for restoration. To evaluate the DE Sampler a BACI study model was implemented with reference sites in non-adjacent watersheds for comparison to the study area, along with comparison at all sites to grab-sample methods used to assess contact standards. A novel indication of strong correlation is observed between cumulative sampling with DE Samplers and very frequent grab-sampling with membrane filtration of the water column, and with the low-cost compartment bag test (CBT, Aquagenex) across multiple watersheds and time-intervals. The DE sampler allowed for a cost-effective fecal profiling strategy that yielded a more-informed diagnoses of fecal contaminant presence than standard grab-sampling alone, and when combined with general water quality monitoring suggested a likelihood for the drivers of eutrophication during summer months to also lead to fecal growth and persistence in the primary stream study area.

Reforest the Bluegrass is an annual program through the city of Lexington, KY that picks one site each year to host a community tree-planting event. This study focused on herbaceous understory growth as an analysis of the forest health as ground cover and species diversity of native verses invasive and introduced flora. Preliminary results suggested that there was some diversity of native species, but that invasive and introduced species were also present in all sites and in some cases made up the majority of the groundcover, as in one site where Euonymus fortunei had approximately 52.7% of total groundcover. 163 taxa were observed in total across all sites, but on some of the sites that had greater invasive coverage the species richness was as low as 16 taxa, while some of the better maintained sites had as many as 40 taxa. The disruption following initial planting creates an ideal environment for introduced species to enter, and, if left unchecked, they can easily take over an area. Management to control invasive species following initial planting is needed to maintain healthy sites.

Kentucky may be in the process of changing its historical weather patterns. Kentucky has a temperate climate and, usually, a high level of humidity. Each of the seasons lasted three months in the past. Now, fall and spring appear to be one or two months, while summer appears to be five months (May through September). Fall corresponds to October and November while winter appears to last from December to February. Spring comes in with March and ends with May, with an occasional polar vortex bringing a freeze after plants are coming out of dormancy.

Kentucky appears to be in the process of moving from a four-season weather pattern to a monsoonal weather pattern. A longer planting season at the beginning and end of plant life cycle underlines the changing in the weather patterns. With the changing of the weather pattern, the slow absorption of water through the snow and ice of winter is changing to rain that is often heavier than the soil can absorb, resulting in run-off. This is detrimental to farms by carrying topsoil and fertility away from the farm. These heaver rains leave the land wet longer so historical planting times may be delayed, while longer summers with heat dry out the land and leave an arid condition hampering traditional Kentucky agricultural production. Farmers need to adapt to and mitigate the effects of weather for sustainable farm production.

There are many name brand fertilizers that are used today in gardening in the state of Kentucky. Due to the standardization of name brand fertilizer production in factories, this can cause the fertilizers to compromise the nutrients of soil, while all-natural fertilizers are seen as better quality for the consumers, plants and soils. Alaska, Miracle Grow, Monty's, Pure Gold, Tiger Bloom are the top five fertilizers sold in the state of Kentucky. This study aims to determine the impact of five top commercial fertilizers on soil quality indicators including organic matter, acidity level and moisture content. These fertilizers were applied to the plots that were cultivated for tomatoes and marigolds for 13 weeks from May 17 to August 11, 2020. There were 36 individual plots measuring 0.1524m by 0.1524m, 18 tomato plants and 18 marigolds with six being control plots, three for tomato plants and three for marigolds. Each fertilizer was placed on three different plants selected randomly based on the directions on the back of the fertilizer container. The results will be discussed during the presentation. The information from this research will help gardeners to select the most useful fertilizers for tomatoes and marigolds as well give the best soil quality.

Photochemical oxidation, a reaction where a catalyst absorbs visible light to oxidize other molecules, is advantageous because the proton absorption leaves no residue, whereas most other chemical methods involve the use of toxic or polluting reagents. This process is similar to how plants absorb sunlight to excite electrons in different molecules in photosynthesis to form adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In this work, we have found that a family of alkynes with a double bond, namely ene-ynamides, in the presence of 2,6-lutidine N-oxide and visible light generated nitrogen-containing bicyclic rings termed 3-azra-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane compounds through possible alkyne radical cation intermediates. These nitrogen-containing bicyclic compounds are important intermediate for several pharmaceuticals such as the antidepressant milnacipran. Previous synthesis of these compounds requires harsh reaction conditions as well as precious metal catalysts, a pharmaceutical concern as some metal residuals remain in the drugs. However, we have developed a new synthetic method of organic synthesis with alkynes that is both metal-free and sustainable. The generality and usefulness of this new catalytic method has been further demonstrated by the variety of bicyclic compounds with different electronic structures that are formed.

A brownfield is an abandoned industrial or commercial site affected by some level of contamination. Our goal was to apply a collaborative framework to enhance community engagement in risk assessment and decision-making. After searching for brownfield sites in northern Kentucky, we focused on the historic Marianne Theater in Bellevue. City leaders are actively searching for a developer, but before the building can be used again, the risks from lead-based paint and asbestos must be mitigated. Three key outputs will be a promotional video highlighting the value of the theater, a GIS analysis of parking capacity in the surrounding business district, and a survey of brownfield developers highlighting best practices for redevelopment of historic properties in small to medium-sized cities.

On 21 June 2019, a powerful derecho propagated over a 1,500 km path of destruction from Nebraska to the Carolinas causing millions of dollars of property damage and three fatalities. The derecho peaked in intensity over western and central Kentucky and Tennessee spawning multiple tornadoes and generating multiple straight-line wind reports estimated at over 120 km/hr. Satellite data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Comprehensive Large Array-data Stewardship System was used for this analysis. NOAA Big Data Project NEXRAD Level-II from Amazon Web Servers was also analyzed using Gibson Ridge software. The 21 June 2019 derecho was found to exhibit classic mesoscale convective complex structure with an expansive cloud shield below -52°C. Radar revealed a powerful rear inflow jet and bright banding. Understanding the satellite and radar characteristics of this storm can help weather forecasters better predict derechos in the future.

Chitwan is a rapidly developing district, located in the central-southern part of Nepal. There is a trend of migration from other parts of the country for better services and education. This study was conducted to assess the land used and Land Cover (LULC) class and its changes over time from 2009 and 2020. The satellite images (2009 and 2020) were downloaded from the United States Geological Survey Earth Explorer and vector file of administrative boundaries of study area from Nepal (NPL) Administrative Boundary Common Operational Database (COD-AB). Then, images were classified into six classes using maximum likelihood supervised classification in ERDAS IMAGINE version 16.5. The highest increase was found in buildup area with a 136.34% increase followed by a 50.42% increase in grassland. Agriculture land area did not change a significant amount, while forest cover decreased (4.49%) significantly. The study showed a negative correlation between change in agriculture land cover and built-up area. This study suggests an immediate need for policy change to protect quality agricultural land from real-estate and commercial land acquisition, and sustainable utilization of available natural resources.

Kīlauea is an active shield volcano located on the eastern side of Hawai‘i Island. Since the summit collapse and eruption of the East Rift Zone between April 30 and August 2, 2018, volcanic ash, earthquakes reaching a magnitude of 5, and lava which erupted from fissures 1-24 were reported. Since the event is relatively recent, the research on the volcano's potential hazards and societal risks are poorly understood. Therefore, the objective of this research is to map fissures activated from summit collapses by combining remote sensing techniques, field studies and petrographic analysis to investigate hazards volcanic activity had on the surrounding area and how it impacted those living around the fissures. Our preliminary results show (1) the fractures within the fissures, which are the main pathways of the lavaflow, affecting populated landscapes; trend predominantly northeast direction and (2) the majority of lavaflow samples collected from the study area show vesicular textures and homogenous composition with little diversity. This research will aid in better understanding the fissures at Kīlauea and potential hazards that affected and can continue to affect the infrastructures and biodiversity on fissure-prone areas. Ongoing research on samples will aid in determining their origin and temperatures from which they erupted.

Land use and climate change are two key factors that directly affect hydrological processes. It is essential to consider these changes and their impacts for sustainable land use and water resources management planning. Watershed models provide a dynamic framework for the study of hydrological processes and their response to both natural and anthropogenic causes. The SWAT (Soil and Watershed Assessment Tools) model has been used as an effective tool for modelling the impacts of land use and climate change on hydrology. In this study, we evaluated the impacts of land use and climate variability using a dispersed hydrological SWAT model in the Bell watershed of rural Kentucky. To evaluate the model results, the Nash-Sutcliffe Model Efficiency Coefficient (NSE), Percent Bias (PBIAS) and Coefficient of Determination (R)2 are calculated. Preliminary findings revealed that the SWAT model proved to be a useful instrument for simulating the impacts of environmental change on surface hydrology. Although hydrological impacts of land use change and climate change exist at all spatial scales, regional and local research are more significant in order to provide critical information for local environmental protection. This study will provide policy makers with valuable knowledge for sustainable development with effective management of water resources.

Purpose: This ecological analysis investigates the spatial patterns of the COVID-19 epidemic in the U.S. in relation to socioeconomic variables that characterize U.S. counties.

Methods: Data on confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 for 2,814 U.S. counties were obtained from Johns Hopkins University. We used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to map the spatial aspects of this pandemic and investigate the disparities between metropolitan and non-metropolitan communities. Multiple regression models were used to explore the contextual risk factors of infections and death across U.S. counties. We included population density, percent of population aged 65+, percent population in poverty, percent minority population, and percent of the uninsured as independent variables. A state level measure of the percent of the population that has been tested for COVID-19 was used to control the impact of testing.

Findings: The impact of COVID-19 has been extremely uneven across the U.S. Although densely populated large cities and their surrounding metropolitan areas are hotspots of the pandemic, it is counterintuitive that incidence and mortality rates in some small cities and non-metropolitan counties approximate those in epicenters such as New York City. Regression analyses support the hypotheses of positive correlations between COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates and socioeconomic factors including population density, proportions of elderly residents, poverty, and percent population tested.

Conclusions: Knowledge about the spatial aspects of the COVID-19 epidemic and its socioeconomic correlates can inform first responders and government rescue efforts. Directives for social distancing and to ‘shelter-in-place’ should continue to stem the spread of COVID-19.

Various biophysical factors can have a significant influence on watershed sediment yields in temperate climate zones. Soil erosion will typically be limited to steeper slopes and/or more erodible soils during the peak growing season when denser vegetation stands protect the ground cover. As vegetation cover senesces, post-harvest and during cooler conditions across fall and winter, the potential for soil erosion and subsequent sediment yields increases, particularly during wetter periods. Focusing on the Upper Floyds Fork watershed, Kentucky, we applied the GIS-based hydrological/soil erosion model ArcSWAT to identify areas within the watershed acting as significant sediment contributors over a single growing season. We obtained daily hydro-meteorological data including runoff, max/min air temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, wind speed and solar radiation. Spatial and temporal vegetation changes were estimated from MODIS Leaf Area Index (LAI) imagery. ArcSWAT modeled the sediment yields using the modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE) developed from a series of rasters to represent the soil erodibility (K), topographic (LS) and land cover/vegetation (C) factors across the watershed. To calibrate the model output we generated our own daily sediment yield dataset by deploying a turbidity sensor at the watershed outlet in situ with a USGS streamflow gage. From this we constructed a statistical relationship between turbidity and suspended sediment samples obtained for a range of flow conditions. Our results indicated that watershed sediment yields were strongly influenced by various biophysical factors, including changing vegetation cover and precipitation distribution across the growing season.

Though walking is one of the most common physical activity, rural American residents walk 13% less than urban populations because rural residents are less likely to be have the available infrastructure (Wiggs 2008). Appalachian Americans are at risk for chronic disease and premature death (Summers n.d.). In 2019, the city of Berea connected two previously separated 1 mile segments to created a 3.2 mile multiuse path out an area national attraction. The purpose of this study was to: 1) examine the health impact of the connector trail on user characteristics, 2) examine trail use during the months of April – July during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 3) calculate annual users for the completed trail. This study measured the health impact of this connector trail and monitored the oscillation of trail use during the COVID-19 pandemic during the summer of 2020. A survey and infrared trail counters were used to gather data about users health status, frequency of visits, and COVID-19 impact. The study found a 20,000 user increase on Stephenson trail, and 9,989 annual users for Short Line Pike trail. Sixty four percent of users stated that the connector trail had changed their activity level. 48% of users said their trail use was effected by the Pandemic. Though trail use increased 98% of users said they were social distancing. Most users answered that they were in overall good-very good health and were active for 4.43 days of the week. These results align with other trail health interventions that showed increases in trail use after new infrastructure is built (Wiggs 2008, Grunseit 2019). Users reported the connector trail had increased their trail use. Trail use during the year of 2020 has also seen an increase due to the COVID-19 pandemic as it replaces closed gyms and recreational facilities. The health of trail users is good and their exercise patterns are meeting American Heart Association guidelines.

Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is a pollutant and a known carcinogen. Exposure from BaP can come from vehicle emissions, tobacco smoke, and grilled food. BaP exposure has been linked to learning deficits as well as delays in neurological development in both animals and humans. We used a mouse model to mimic the human genetic variation in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and CYP1A2, which are genes related to BaP metabolism. Pregnant mice were dosed with BaP in corn oil soaked cereal or the corn oil vehicle from gestational day 10 to weaning at postnatal day 25 (P25). We tested neonatal reflexes using the righting reflex test at P5, 7 and 10. We also used the negative geotaxis test at P7, 10, and 14. We compared three genotypes of mice to determine if genetic differences affected susceptibility to BaP. We found that both treatment and genotype affected the mice's' reflex performance on the tests.

The purpose of the study is as follows: a) to investigate the overall health of hikers at the Pinnacles in Berea, Kentucky, b) to determine the dimensions of health satisfied by utilizing hiking trails, c) to observe whether hikers were complying with social distancing guidelines. The Pinnacles opened on June 1, 2020, due to the statewide stay at home on March 25, 2020. An intercept survey asked participants: (1) to select all dimensions of health that was satisfied when going on their hiking excursion, (2) their level of physical activity, (3) how long they were planning to hike, and (4) if they were following social distancing guidelines in their hike, and their physical activity levels. Lawn posters were displayed on June 26, 2020, and business cards were distributed the same day to alert trail users of the survey requesting users to stop and complete the survey. Data was collected from June 26-July 13 during the daylight hours (8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.). The results indicated that hikers come from outside Berea city limits (75%) and are relatively healthy (median physical activity (PA) minutes are 120, the average number of days exercising is 4 days). Motivators were mainly exercise, relaxation, recreation, and family time. Physical, emotional, and social health were the dimensions of health satisfaction by hikers. 96% of hikers followed social distancing guidelines. These findings indicate the importance of expanding our concepts of health and community care. Future studies should include community health initiatives and events that utilize the Pinnacles.

Physiological variations are ubiquitous in human motor control, e.g. grip force exerted while holding a coffee mug consists of multiple minute fluctuations. Entropy-based analysis elucidates that such fluctuations pathologically contribute to motor deficits accompanying neurological ailments, such as stroke. It is, therefore, important to understand and characterize the mechanisms underlying grip force variability. Existing evidence underscores the role of primary motor cortex (M1), a parietal brain region, in executing grip force-based grasping tasks. Yet, it is unclear how integrity of M1 contributes to the complexity within grip force variability. Aiming to address this research gap, we hypothesized that changes in integrity of M1 would disrupt the grip force variability. We recruited ten healthy, young adults and instructed them to perform multiple trials of a grip force-based grasping task. Owing to heterogeneity in previous reports, the current project was focused on optimizing the parameters critical for entropy-based complexity assessment of grip force, namely, sample length (N), embedding dimension (m), and timescale (t). Our analysis indicated that m = 2, for a minimum of N = 600 samples per trial provided a consistent measure of sample entropy, enabling assessment of t = 8 timescales for multi-scale entropy analysis. Subsequently, we plan to assess changes in grip force entropy (conveying complexity in the grip force variability) when participants underwent inhibitory noninvasive brain stimulation versus sham (placebo) over M1 using transcranial magnetic stimulation in a crossover design. This study will help us determine how M1 contributes to the complexity within grip force variability thereby, elucidating associated neural mechanisms.

Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is a carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon commonly found in traffic-related air pollution, tobacco smoke, and grilled foods. BaP is linked to learning deficits and to neurodevelopmental delays in human and animal studies. We are using a mouse model to determine if genetic differences increase susceptibility to BaP exposure during early brain development. Mice lacking the CYP1A2 metabolic enzyme and wild type control mice were exposed to BaP from gestational day 10 (GD10) through weaning at postnatal day 25 (P25). A battery of motor function tests were performed when the mice reached young adulthood (P60). We used a pole climb test and rotarod to assess motor function and motor learning. There was a significant main effect of genotype with the time to turn (P < 0.001) and the total time to descend the pole (P < 0.01). In the rotarod test, there was also a main effect of genotype with AhrbCyp1a2(-/-) knockout mice showing impaired performance on Days 1, 2 and 5 of the test. This suggests that early life BaP exposure has minimal effect on motor function in adults.

Fish mince from deboned Asian carp can be made into fish meat balls, sausages and other value added products. However, polyunsaturated fatty acid in fish mince is susceptible to oxidation leading to quality deterioration of fish mince and products made from it. There is a growing interest in using natural ingredients rich in antioxidants in the protection of food products. The objective of this project was to determine the effects of natural ingredients on the lipid oxidation in fish mince from Asian carp.

Fish mince was prepared from Asian carp by deboning through 3 mm orifice. Fish mince was mixed with cryoprotectants (40 g sucrose, 40 g sorbitol, and 3g tripolyphoshate per Kg) or natural ingredients (powdered ginger, sage and rosemary) at 0.5%, 1%, and 2%, respectively. Fish mince with no additives was used as the control. The samples were stored at -20 C for one month before the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were determined after the samples were placed on ice for up to 16 days. During refrigerated storage, the TBARS values of the fish mince increased from 0.013 increased to mg 0.048 MDA/kg after 16 days (Control group) and from 0.014 to 0.039 mg MDA/kg (Cryoprotectant group), respectively. However with the addition of natural ingredients, the TBARS value of mince remained relatively low (0.008-0.013 mg MDA/kg). Use of natural ingredients, such as, ginger, sage or rosemary powders may be used to help to maintain the quality of fish mince from Asian carp.

Harvesting Asian carp for human consumption is one approach to eliminate this invasive species from Kentucky waters. Deboned Asian carp meat can be made into sausages. The objective of this project was to determine the effect of water content on the textural characteristics fish sausages prepared from deboned silver carp meat. Silver carp captured from the Mississippi River were deboned and ground through a 3-mm screen. Deboned silver carp meat was blended for 30 minutes in a blender (KSM75WH, KitchenAid, Benton Harbor, MI) with 2% salt and 10% cornstarch with 0%, 5%, 10%, 20% or 30% of water added. The resulting meat paste was stuffed into synthetic casing and heated in a water bath at 90°C for 30 minutes. Sausage samples (length: 2.5 cm) were evaluated for texture profile with a texture analyzer (TA.XT Plus, Texture Technologies Corp., Hamilton, MA). Increasing water content decreased the hardness of sausage linearly. Adhesiveness was lowest when 10% of water was added. These results suggest that 10% of water may be added into the meat paste to improve the textural quality of fish sausage by making it less tough and adhesive.

On an n-by-n chessboard, two squares are at most two queen or rook moves from each other. We ask how many blocking pieces (“pawns”) need to be placed on the board to increase the maximum possible distance d (“diameter”) from 2 to some other desired number. We produce an algorithm to answer the question for given values of n and d. We show that, for n > 2, to increase the diameter for queens and rooks to 3, one pawn is needed. Also, for n > 4, to increase the diameter to 4, three pawns are needed for the queens and two pawns for the rooks.

The treatment of chronic wounds has long been a challenge to wound care professionals and presents a substantial economic burden to healthcare systems globally. Over $50 billion is spent on the treatment of chronic wounds each year, with the annual cost rising as chronic wounds are becoming more prevalent and difficult to treat. To combat this issue, a mathematical model describing the interactions between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), their regulators (TIMPs), fibroblasts, and the extracellular matrix (ECM), which is the primary measure for the healing response in the wound, was developed and analyzed to find the most influential factors, or parameters, in the healing process of diabetic foot ulcers. Using the differential equation model with de-identified patient data, the three-dimensional geometry of parameter space was visualized for all pairwise combinations of the twelve parameters in the model to more precisely see how these parameters affect the biological system. Knowledge of the identifiability of parameters can, in turn, streamline treatment by allowing us to individualize treatment for each patient. This approach plots two parameters against the sum of squared errors to generate a three-dimensional graph. By analyzing the minimum of the graph, we can conclude if a parameter is able to be uniquely determined, or identified. The identifiability of a parameter signifies its importance in the healing response. This research shows that the parameters associated with the regulators of MMPs (TIMPs) are the most influential in a wound-healing model. Parameter eigenvalues estimations were then analyzed for each combination to validate findings.

In this paper are obtained an implementation and graphical results, from a series expansion of a previously discovered travelling-wave voltage function, described by a solution to the Hodgkin-Huxley action potential equations. Using the Mathematica-based analysis of the previously derived voltage function, there are obtained well-shaped graphs that behave as solitons under interactions with other waves. Calculations, using the aforementioned voltage function with numerical values for the system parameters, indicate that the theoretically predicted travelling-wave potential solution matches the experimentally observed action potential of the neuron; these results have been demonstrated herein.

We consider a variation of cops and robbers on a graph where the cop seeks to determine the location of an invisible robber moving around vertices of a graph. On the cop's turn, she probes a set of vertices in the graph and receives the distance from each probed vertex to the robber. On the robber's turn, he is allowed to move to an adjacent vertex unless it was just probed by the cop. The robber is successful if the cop is never able to determine his location.

In this talk, we will further introduce cops and robbers on a graph by discussing motivating questions for this research and existing results in the literature. We will also present a strategy that locates the robber on the Grötszch graph in three turns.

Bacteria from the Kentucky River were cultured on tryptic soy agar supplement with mercury (10 µg/mL). Isolates were selected with preference for those with unique colony morphologies and color. DNA was isolated followed by polymerase chain reaction for the 16S rRNA gene. Sequencing revealed the overwhelming majority of the isolates were members of the Bacillus genus. At present, it is unclear why mercury-resistant Bacillus are present in the Kentucky River where the concentration of this metal is low.

This research project investigated the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus versus antibiotic-sensitive Staphylococcus Aureus within the Berea College community. Bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus are part of our healthy human flora. When our human flora are exposed to pathogenic bacterial strains, such as S. aureus, the normal skin flora's beneficiary bacteria, such as Staphylococcus epidermis, will attack the foreign pathogens. If the S. aureus infects the tissues or wound site, it could cause localized infections, abscess, pneumonia, or joint/bone infections. Antibiotics are typically used to treat or prevent certain bacterial infections and could be considered powerful drugs that kill bacteria or slow their growth. The problem is the inappropriate use of antibiotics, such as S. aureus, has led to the development of antibiotic-resistant strains. This antibiotic resistance eliminates the effectiveness of antibiotics allowing the bacteria to survive and continue replication. The purpose of my study was to investigate the prevalence of S. aureus on human skin and determine the sensitivity of the bacterium to antibiotics. The results of this study demonstrates that no single antibiotic worked for 100% of the isolates and different isolates of S. aureus demonstrates different patterns of antibiotic sensitivities. The researchers attribute the multiple drug-resistant strains of S. aureus to the pervasive over-use and over-prescription of antibiotics.

Antibiotics have been used for years to treat infections and save lives. Unfortunately, antibiotic use has also led to bacterial resistance. This project focuses on the use of essential oils (EOs) as alternatives to traditional antibiotics and investigates whether similar resistance patterns are observed. EOs were selected based on their reported disinfecting potential and included seven oils: oregano, peppermint, cinnamon, lavender, tea tree, lemon, and a disinfecting oil blend (“germ fighter”). Seven oil components: thymol, linalyl acetate, limonene, trans-cinnamaldehyde, (+)- terpinen-4-ol, menthol, and carvacrol were also investigated. Research included verifying that the oils possess bactericidal effects against Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and examining the bacteria's resistance capabilities. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values determined for the oils were as follows: peppermint and oregano: 1.25 µL/mL, tea tree: 2.5 µL/mL, cinnamon: 0.125 µL/mL, lavender: 5 µL/mL, lemon: >5 µL/mL, camphor: >10 µL/mL, and germ fighter: 1.25 µL/mL. The MICs of the components were thymol: 10 µL/mL, linalyl acetate: >5 µL/mL, trans-cinnamaldehyde: 0.3 µL/mL, (+)-terpinen-4-ol: 1.25 µL/mL, menthol: 10 µL/mL, and carvacrol: 1.25 µL/mL. Resistance propagations, conducted for at least five days in culture tubes and at least seven days in flasks, indicated an increased resistance to most oils before the resistance level either became constant or collapsed (where the culture failed to grow at the previous highest tolerable concentration). E. coli cultures took more days to begin developing resistance to peppermint than other EOs, while the cultures never developed resistance to tea tree oil.

The fungus Microbotryum lychnidis-dioicae infects Silene latifolia of the Caryophyllaceae family and causes anther smut disease in flowers. Although this fungal pathogen-plant host relation serves a popular model to study ecology, evolution and host specificity, the molecular mechanisms of the parasitism remain unclear. During infection the fungus synthesizes and releases effector proteins into plant tissues to modify metabolism and structures of the host to benefit the fungal colonization. Our study is to identify the plant protein targets during infection for two fungal effector proteins. We report phenotype changes of the plant host due to the protein-protein interactions, and seek to reveal the subcellular locations of the interactions in the plant cells by fluorescent tags. The two effector proteins are MVLG_06175 and MVLG_05122. Our previous study showed that MVLG_06175 interacts with CASP-like protein 2C1 associated with the formation of the Casparian strip in the roots, while the MVLG_05122 target is COP9 signalosome subunit 5a and 5b associated with the inhibition of a ubiquitin ligase that facilitates protein ubiquitination and degradation and may be associated with pathogen susceptibility. These results indicate M. lychnidis-dioicae might apply the two effector proteins to penetrate into the vascular tissues and to alter rates of protein renewing in the plant host. A preliminary trial on the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana showed that overexpression of MVLG_05122 caused significantly early bolting and flowering compared with the control. We are currently labeling the two effector proteins with fluorescent tags and overexpressing the genetic constructs in A. thaliana.

COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by WHO on March 11, 2020. The etiological agent, SARS-CoV-2, is a novel coronavirus first emerged in Wuhan, China. Genetic analysis suggested that this virus emerged as a result of recombination between a bat-associated virus and a pangolin virus. As of September 27, 2020, there were 32,730,945 confirmed cases with 991,224 fatalities globally. United States alone had more 200,000 deaths due to this emerging infectious disease. Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as wearing face mask and social distancing are effective measures, but a safe and effective vaccine that provides protection to the immunized and interrupts spreading of this virus is urgently needed. In addition to traditional vaccine technologies, such as inactivated virus vaccine, attenuated virus vaccine, and subunit vaccine, etc., novel technologies, such as use of messenger RNA, are being developed. Testing of vaccines involves at least Phase I to III clinical trials. We examine over twenty vaccine candidates that are undergoing clinical trials, and compare and contrast among these vaccine candidates. It is anticipated that this study provides an insight into COVID-19 vaccine development, and to identify protocols that facilitate rapid development of vaccines for emerging infectious diseases.

I will present X-ray and UV/optical observations obtained by the NASA Neil Gehrels Swift mission of the radio-loud Quasar PKS 2135-147 (PHL 1657). PKS2135 was first optically identified in 1966 as a Quasar, and it is variable in X-rays on the time scales of months to years. It has been observed by Swift since 2013. Optical spectroscopy data analyzed in this study are from 2004 observations obtained at the MDM observatory at Kitt Peak in Arizona. I will discuss the X-Ray variability of this source, as well as the UV results and projected results of the optical spectra. A long-term goal of this project is to gain familiarity with the Broad-Line Region of the Quasar, as well as determine the mass of the central black hole.

A specific example of a chaotic system is a damped driven oscillator (DDO), as it exhibits chaoticity at certain conditions. The system has been studied by other researchers, including DeSerio (2003) and Kulkarni and Borkar (2015) using different approaches and software from MATLAB to Phaser Scientific Software. One underutilized tool is the bifurcation diagram, which shows the period doubling effect of many mechanical systems. Due to this general unpopularity, the current available bifurcation diagrams of the system are of lesser quality than what modern equipment could provide. The goal of this project is to obtain higher quality bifurcation diagrams for the DDO. We plan on using a very high-quality encoder for acquiring data, which will increase the clarity and quality of the results by a considerable margin. LabVIEW is used as the software to develop the data acquisition system, which logs the angular position and angular velocity of the system throughout its movement. The ODEs for the system were studied numerically using the well-known Runge-Kutta method of solving ODEs. Using the data collected from the LabVIEW program, Project Jupyter's program Jupyter Notebook is utilized to run Python code to create phase portraits, Poincaré sections (commonly referred to as Poincaré maps), and the bifurcation diagrams.

The Duffing Oscillator (DO) is a bistable, nonlinear oscillator initially described by Georg Duffing in Erzwungene schwingungen bei veränderlicher eigenfrequenz und ihre technische bedeutung. Braunschweig, F. Vieweg & sohn (1918). Due to its nonlinear nature, the DO is an excellent system to study a stochastic resonance, a phenomenon also occurring in ring lasers, electron paramagnetic resonance and other non-linear systems. Stochastic resonance is a phenomenon whereby a system experiences resonance due to noise being added to it. Optimal stochastic resonance occurs when the optimal amount of noise is added. In this talk, we present the progress in development of a magnetically driven mechanical model of the DO. The design is inspired by the one proposed in Donoso, Ladera, Eur. J. Phys. 33 (2012), where a high-power rare earth magnet is attached to a spring and placed inside a small copper coil. Potential energy of the system can be described by a fourth order function and is called Duffing potential. The second coil placed underneath of the experimental setup provides an external periodic and white noise forces. The external force magnitude is controlled via the electrical current passing through this coil. To constrain the horizontal oscillations of the magnet we introduced a linear bearing and a vertical shaft as a guide rail for the magnet. A LabVIEW DAQ system was designed and programmed to collect experimental data and control the system's parameters. This project is supported by the KAS Research Grant, project ID # 23270225.

Solar limb darkening is a prominent feature seen in white images of the sun: the brightness of the solar disk is greatest at its center and decreases moving outward to the limb. Using a solar projection method and recording an image of the sun with a cellphone camera allows students an opportunity to investigate this phenomenon with their own data. From our earlier studies, we conclude that white light images prove useful only for qualitative observations. Splitting images into the RGB band images has shown promise for comparing to wavelength dependent models of solar limb darkening. We discuss our results obtained with a variety of smartphone cameras: our experiments exhibit saturation in the red (and sometimes the green) channel. We posit that this results from “optical brighteners” in the paper on which the solar image is projected and discuss future experiments to evaluate this hypothesis.

The January 20-21, 2019 total lunar eclipse was visible throughout most of the Americas and parts of Europe and Western Africa. Many Unihedron Sky Quality Meter (SQM) users serendipitously recorded the event. We will present a collection of zenith sky brightness (ZSB) curves from multiple locations. We qualitatively analyze the effects of latitude and weather on observations and discuss the scientific and educational uses of such data. We conclude with suggestions for future “coordinated observing campaigns” such as the importance of obtaining simultaneous all-sky images to better understand the effects of clouds on ZSB measurements during eclipse observations.

NKU's Schneider Observatory, located on campus atop Founder's Hall, features a 14-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope mounted on a German equatorial mount with computer control capabilities. This telescope was brought online over the summer of 2019. The larger size of this telescope coupled with a SBIG STT-3200ME CCD and Johnson filter set, allows us to do precision differential photometry of variable objects. Over the last year, we took data on several targets including variable stars and transiting exoplanets. In this presentation, we will discuss our current instrument setup, photometric pipeline, and the resulting light curves.

This talk will focus on examining eclipsing binaries from a catalog of systems with potential delta Scuti-type pulsation (Soydugan et al. 2006) that have recently released TESS data available for analysis. All systems found to have pulsation from the available TESS data that have not yet been reported in the literature will be presented, along with initial analysis of the dominant pulsation periods. No attempt at mode identification or asteroseismology will be done presently, but will be the next step in this continuing work.

I will report on X-ray and Ultraviolet/Optical observations of the Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxy RX J1117+6522. This NLS1 has been observed by the NASA Neil Gehrels Swift observatory since 2006 and has exhibited strong flux and spectral variability. In particular RX J1117+6522 has shown strong changes in the optical to X-ray spectral slope alpha-ox. This slope describes the strength of the accretion disk to the accretion disk corona. The strong changes in alpha-ox in RX J1117+6522 may suggest a weakening and build-up again of the accretion disk corona.

I will report on X-ray and Ultraviolet/Optical observations of the Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxy Mkn 110. This galaxy is unusual among NLS1s due to its strong emission from the Narrow Line Region, while exhibiting very weak FeII emission. The NASA Neil Gehrels Swift mission had started observing Mkn 110 since 2010 and has intensively observed it in 2017 with three observations per day. I will present the long term lightcurves of Mkn 110 and will discuss spectral changes with respect to previous observations, in particular ROSAT.

I will report on the most recent activity observed in the Narrow Line Seyfert 1 Galaxy Mkn 335. The NASA Neil Gehrels Swift mission has monitored Mkn 335 since it was discovered in an extremely X-ray low state in May 2007. Mkn 335 has exhibited various state of activity with repeated flaring activity. However, since 2018 it had been in a constant low state with no activity. When it was observed again but Swift after emerging from its sun-constraint in May 2020 it seem to have woken up again and has displayed several flaring activities. I will discuss the recent variability found in Mkn 335 in the context of a partial covering absorber model.

The goal of the project is to develop a computer interface to provide verbal description of scent using a set of experimentally obtained gas column chromatograms. Odors are grouped together by using qualitative resemblances. These groups, known as scent families, include floral, citrus, leather, woody, aromatic, oriental, and green. Substances with many “spicy” notes belong to oriental family, those with “tobacco” notes are members of the leather family. Scent family definitions are highly subjective, and vary with brand and manufacturer. In an attempt to better understand odor perception, Andrew Dravnieks, in “The Atlas of odor character profiles” (1985), provided a quantitative definition for these families. For 160 chemicals, 140 volunteers were asked to survey 160 chemicals using 146 descriptors. The list of descriptors included terms such as seasoning and citrus. All verbal descriptors were rated for applicability for a given chemical on a 0 (not applicable) to 5 (highly applicable) scale. We quantify scent families using Multisensory Gas Chromatography (MGC) technique, a hybrid approach combining gas chromatography and artificial olfactory principles, where chemicals are separated by catalytic reactivity which provides an extra dimension to conventional analytical gas chromatography. To build correspondence between scent family chromatograms and a set of corresponding verbal descriptors, we propose to employ a Convolutional Neural Network, trained and validated on an experimentally obtained data. We will discuss the development of the MGC experimental setup, present preliminary experimental data, and discuss verbal description data clustering. The project is supported by the KY NSF EPSCoR URE program.

We have begun studying the use of Mie scattering as a tool to measure the concentration of respiratory microdroplets, one possible vector for the transmission of the COVID-19 novel coronavirus. This form of scattering is a relatively straightforward solution to Maxwell's Equations for monochromatic electromagnetic waves – laser light – by homogeneous spherical particles approximately the same size as the wavelength of the incident light. We will discuss the basic theory of Mie Scattering, describe our simple optical measurements, and present preliminary data that evaluates Mie Scattering as a diagnostic for potential public health applications.

Membrane proteins are essential in controlling bioenergetics, functional activity, and triggring signal pathways in various biological systems. In spite of their biological significance, limited structural information is currently available due to challenges in applying biophysical techniques for studying these protein systems. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a rapidly growing powerful biophysical technique to study structural and dynamic properties of membrane proteins. We are applying several structural biology techniques of EPR spectroscopy such as EPR spectral lineshape analysis, power saturation EPR, and double electron electron resonance (DEER) to investigate structural properties of complex biological systems KCNE3 in various membrane environments including lipodisq nanoparticles. KCNE3 is an integral membrane protein that modulates the function and trafficking of several voltage gated potassium channels, including KCNQ1. The CW-EPR spectral measurements indicate an increase in spectral line broadening with the addition of the styrene–maleic acid (SMA) polymer to liposomes which approaches close to the rigid limit providing a homogeneous stabilization of the protein–lipid complex. Similarly, EPR DEER measurements provide a superior quality of distance measurement with an increase in the phase memory time (Tm) values upon incorporation of the sample into lipodisq nanoparticles when compared to liposomes. These results are consistent with the solution NMR structural studies on the KCNE3.

Quantum tic-tac-toe is a game developed to illustrate the counterintuitive nature of quantum systems. The most common version of the game includes states, superposition, collapse, nonlocality, and entanglement. While the game can provide a foundation for understanding many quantum principles, it can also be overwhelming for students new to quantum mechanics. In this talk, we introduce a simplified version of quantum tic-tac-toe that does not include entanglement. Nevertheless, there are several novel quantum features that merit study. We report on our progress writing a Python version of the game (appropriate from classrooms with a projector or remote instruction), modeling this game as a probabilistic finite automata to investigate possible winning strategies, and simulating a version as a quantum circuit acting on qubits. We also report on the experiences of students without quantum mechanics experience playing this simplified version of the classic (though not classical!) game.

Modification of tRNA is important for cell growth and translation, and errors can lead to disease. Of the nearly 100 known tRNA modifications, the enzymes responsible for several modifications are not known. One of these modification is 2′-O-methylation of residue 39 (Nm39) in plants and animals. The goal of this research is to identify the enzyme responsible for the Nm39 modification in plants by expressing plant tRNA and candidate genes in yeast, which do not possess the modification. Presence of Nm39 on tRNA would indicate that the candidate gene is responsible for the modification. Once identified, the human homolog will be identified using bioinformatics.

The transient receptor potential (TRPA - ankyrin) receptor has been linked to pathological conditions in cardiac function in mammals. To better understand the function of the TRPA in regulation of the heart function the Drosophila melanogaster model was used to express TRPA in heart and body wall muscles. Heartbeat of in intact larvae as well as hearts in situ, devoid of hormonal and neural input indicate that strong activation of larvae over expressing TRPA at 30 or 37C stopped the heart from beating, but in a diastolic state. Cardiac function would recover upon cooling and short exposure to high temperature. Parental control (UAS-TRPA) increased heart rate transiently at 30 and 37C and, the heart rates at 370C would slow down within 3 minutes for insitu vs in vivo preparations. The in situ preparations maintained an elevated rate at 30C. The heartbeat in the TRPA expressing line could not be revived at 370C with serotonin. Thus, TRPA activation may have allowed enough Ca2+ influx to activate K(Ca)+ channels into a form of diastolic stasis. TRPA activation in body wall muscle confirmed a depolarization of membrane. The Phaenicia sericata increased heartbeat at 30 and 370C.

Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurring, unpredictable seizures. Its disease burden is high, seeing as it ranks fourth in the world's neurological disorders burden following: tension-type headaches, migraines, and Alzheimer's disease. The commonly used antiepileptic drug levetiracetam (Keppra) reduces epileptic seizures, but the exact mechanism through which it works is not known. Some studies suggest sodium and/or potassium ionic channels are directly altered reducing membrane excitability, while others suggest the drug interacts with SV2 protein to alter synaptotagmin (a calcium sensor protein) action in the presynaptic nerve terminal (reducing excitability). The glutamatergic synapses at crayfish and larval Drosophila neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) were used to assess the drug's action. The evoked excitatory junction potentials (EJPs) of the crayfish NMJ were enhanced through exposure to 1 mM of the drug, but not lower doses, with 20 minutes of stimulation after 10 minutes of static incubation. However, no significant alterations were noted in the amplitude of the EJPs at the Drosophila NMJ during the 20 minutes of stimulation at 5 Hz. The crayfish model effects of levetiracetam were then used as an authentic curriculum undergraduate research experience (ACURE) in a neurophysiology teaching laboratory with 16 students. It appears levetiracetam acts differently in different animal models, or varied experimental conditions are required to note its effects.

In modifying a typical physiological laboratory protocol in measures of the resting membrane potential in relation to the concentration of extracellular potassium ions [K+]o, the additional effects of temperature were addressed. The effects of temperature on the membrane potential are not commonly addressed in experimental physiology and neurophysiology student laboratory exercises. In terms of presenting an authentic application of the experimental design, various topics were highlighted. Heterothermic animals were used as models in addressing the effects of environmental change as one topic, and a second focus was on clinical therapies related to the use of varied temperatures in mammals. A third topic focused on a unified issue with all organisms in temperature changes with cellular metabolism. Experimentally, the skeletal muscle of a crayfish served as a model to obtain data. The crayfish model is robust for long term survival in minimal physiological saline, is easily obtainable, and allows for a relative ease in dissection. Graphing membrane potential in relation to both [K+]o and temperature, along with theoretical curves for the Nernst and Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (G-H-K) equations, provides important distinctions and understanding of the relationship of temperature in these equations. Freely available online software is used in addressing the theoretical values one would expect. Discussion of other factors impacted by temperature for biological membranes will also be covered.

In mammals, sex differences in cocaine-induced locomotor behaviors are well established (Becker & Hu, 2008). Female rats display increased locomotion to cocaine compared to males (Hu & Becker, 2003). This is regulated by estradiol, which agonizes dopaminergic activity within the female brain (Segarra et al., 2010). In female quail, cocaine does not increase locomotion regardless of increased estradiol (Gill et al., 2015). This may be due to the higher D2:D1 dopamine receptor ratio in quail compared to rats (Kleitz et al., 2009). Further studies with nonhuman primates show that greater D2 receptor availability decreases cocaine-seeking behaviors (Nader et al., 2006). This study investigated how the differential expression of D2 receptors in quail affects cocaine-induced locomotion. The overarching hypothesis was that the D2 antagonist eticlopride would dose-dependently enhance locomotor activity to cocaine in both sexes and cause cocaine-induced sensitization in female quail.

Male and female quail were administered eticlopride or vehicle followed by cocaine or vehicle daily for seven days. Quail were then placed in open field chambers, where distance traveled was recorded for 30 minutes. Cocaine-induced sensitization was observed in females pre-treated with 0.03 or 0.05 mg/kg eticlopride but not in cocaine-only females. As predicted for saline pre-treated males, cocaine-induced locomotor activity and sensitization were observed (Gill et al., 2015). Contrary to our hypotheses, eticlopride did not enhance cocaine-induced locomotor activity or produce cocaine-induced sensitization in male quail. Further research is needed to investigate the neuroprotective properties of D2 receptors and potential therapeutic applications for combatting cocaine use disorder.

The only Food and Drug Administration approved drug for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is Riluzole (Rilutek). However, the diverse mechanism of how Riluzole functions physiologically are still being discovered. ALS results in the motor neurons in the spinal cord to die over time. The approach in treatment is to decrease activity of these motor neurons and thus lower the Ca2+ influx during activity to protect these neurons. One approach is to reduce the glutamatergic excitotoxicity of the postsynaptic motor neurons. Riluzole has been shown to antagonize presynaptic NMDA receptors mediated responses as well as directly block neuronal voltage gated Na+ and Ca2+ channels. Glutamate release inhibitors for ALS and Huntington's, such as Riluzole, as therapeutics may have both pre-and post-synaptic mechanisms which are still being investigated. Here the glutamatergic synapses at the crayfish neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) as well as sensory neurons of crabs were used as experimental models. The exposure of 1 mM Riluzole to the crayfish NMJ at first promotes synaptic transmission and then depresses synaptic transmission by blocking presynaptic function. The effects did not reverse readily with removal of Riluzole. We expect Riluzole is decreasing the amplitude of the action potential in the motor neurons by blocking voltage gated Na+ and Ca2+ channels. Proprioceptive sensory neurons in crab were not affected by 1 mM Riluzole but were at 10mM over the same time frame. The amplitude of the action potential with the crayfish motor neurons showed a decrease suggesting a blockage of Na+ channels.

The Center for Disease Control estimates that there are approximately 1.6 to 3.8 million concussions that occur in sport or recreation-related activities per year (Daneshvar et al. 2011). Although mild, these concussions are classified as traumatic brain injuries. Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) cause the release of reactive oxygen species that cause damage to surrounding neuronal cells. Previous studies have examined potential treatments for traumatic brain injury with limited success, partly due to the blood brain barrier. The investigational compound gamma-glutamylcysteine ethyl ester (GCEE) is a reactive oxygen species scavenger that we examined to prevent neuronal injury during a TBI. Further, GCEE is naturally produced in the brain to counteract increased levels of reactive oxygen species to prevent neuronal apoptosis. We treated primary neuronal cells with GCEE (1 mM) pre- and post-traumatic brain injury stimulation of tert-butyl (100 mM) or hydrogen peroxide (100 mM) for 2 and 18 hrs respectively. After which we added 20uL of dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCF), a fluorescence compound, that indicates the formation of reactive oxygen species and read the plate in 2.5 min intervals for 35 minutes. We found a significant decrease in reactive oxygen species production in the wells containing GCEE post-hydrogen peroxide treatment. Our results indicate that GCEE can be a potential TBI therapy, specifically as a post-injury treatment.

Modifying typical physiological laboratory protocols to not only teach, but also conduct authentic research aimed for scientific publications, is very engaging for students. However, there are caveats in conducting experiments in a reproducible manner within a teaching lab with multiple student-driven stations. One approach that appears to offer an authentic research experience while still providing reliable results is to conduct a series of experiments prior to the course to be taught, and have students in the course run the same experiments to compare the novel findings. To reduce biases in analysis, the students are blind to the treatments and can analyze the novel data collected before the teaching lab, as well as their own data collected in class. Knowledge that their data will be peer-reviewed has resulted in students' heightened attention to detail in conducting the experiments and analyses. When presenting the results for publication, the data collected prior to the class is used, as it is tightly controlled to reduce experimental and analysis variability. The classroom results are presented separately with explanations for variation in the experimentation and analysis. We have conducted this approach for six different ACUREs. Student and teaching assistant evaluations of this approach are provided. This approach is also useful for repository data sets provided in scientific publications.

COVID-19 has dramatically affected higher education experience. College students have been impacted in different ways by losing their job, experiencing online learning, and minimizing social activities. This research is based on a survey conducted in April and August 2020. More than 140 undergraduate students participated in the survey. This study examines the effect of pandemic on freshman, junior, and sophomore students.

Many traditional microbiology labs that have been used for decades present little opportunity for critical thinking. After much trial and error, I have developed three projects that allow student groups to generate unique data and inferences. Two address antibiotic resistance, one using culture techniques, the other molecular. The third assess the impact of inputs on the activity of soil enzyme activities. After students present their results, they critique the inferences made each group including their own. In this presentation, I will go over this approach and discuss issues.

Cancer literacy is defined as a person's ability to make appropriate healthcare decisions based off the recommendations of a medical professional. Increased cancer literacy can have a significant impact on Kentucky in particular. Kentucky, specifically the Appalachian region, faces the highest cancer incidence and mortality rates in the country (1). Residents of the Appalachian region are 8% more likely to die from preventable cancer, and this disparity is attributed to factors like tobacco use, obesity, and poverty (2-4). We created a brief cancer education intervention by administering a 10-question pretest to Kentucky middle and high school students, followed by giving a cancer-related presentation. Then, we administered a posttest with identical questions to the pretest. Students also received a 3-month follow-up survey. The results show that the intervention improves cancer knowledge in students. Moreover, it demonstrates that these students are likely to share this information with others. Such an intervention could aid in lowering Kentucky cancer rates. To further improve cancer literacy, we developed lessons to be incorporated into science and/or health classrooms. The lessons are tailored to Kentucky's unique situation and culture. The first lesson teaches students about the basics of cancer, including biology and epidemiology. The second discusses risk factors and modifiable behaviors, while the final lesson covers cancer treatment. These lessons include an instructional PowerPoint presentation, an in-class activity, and a teacher's guide. By making cancer curricula more widely available to students, their cancer literacy will increase, and Kentucky's cancer disparity can be reduced.

In Summer 2020, I redesigned our non-majors microbiology lab for online delivery while attempting to maintain the intellectual and pedagogical integrity of a face-to-face class. Students used lab simulations from Labster, which provided a virtual-reality-like way to master key concepts and techniques. Prior to each Labster lab, they viewed my recorded lectures that set up the most important concepts and techniques within each lab. Each lecture also was delivered with embedded questions to prevent passive watching. Group quizzes and required live online class periods added in necessary discussion time. Finally, students performed a hypothesis-driven multi-day bacterial identification experiment. For four days, they were provided with a daily email with their “data” and they responded with a summary data sheet stating their results, conclusions, and requesting additional experiments. Once they identified their unknown species, they wrote a report detailing their process and explaining the importance of that species. In this manner, we were able to maintain most of our microbiology lab learning objectives while students worked from home.

Mathematics is a common barrier to success for students interested in STEM fields, particularly for students from historically underrepresented minority (URM) populations. Every fall at Northern Kentucky University, an estimated 50-60 students (40% URM) are admitted indicating a desire to major in a STEM discipline but are unable to initially declare due to math requirements. In addition, among all incoming students declaring STEM majors (∼400), approximately 57% are not prepared to take Calculus; URM STEM majors are disproportionately impacted with 87% not prepared to take Calculus.

The STEM Ready program consists of a two-week bridge program and first-year seminar support courses aimed at increasing access, retention, and graduation rates of URM students in STEM by improving math readiness for students enrolled in or interested in STEM programs. The two-week bridge program consists of programming in four areas: math content using the Assessment and Learning in Knowledge Spaces (ALEKS) system; guided STEM research projects in biology, chemistry, and data science; study skills sessions emphasizing growth mindset; and developing a sense of place on campus.

This summer, 22 students enrolled in an online version of the STEM Ready program, 7 of whom advanced their skills enough to result in placement in a higher-level math course. Lessons learned from this pilot program will be incorporated into the online and face-to-face versions that will take place in the summer of 2021.

The demand for online instruction is on the rise. In a classroom setting, research shows that student interactions are important for overcoming common misconceptions, but it is challenging to achieve the same level of engagement in an online setting. To try to improve online interactions in an online physics class at Morehead State University, the Fall 2018 and 2019 online classes were required to post a total of three times about a conceptual physics question in each assignment while following certain criteria. Doing so increased the percentage of students who responded to another student's answer and changed their final answer. This led to an increase in the percentage of students who answered the questions correctly compared to previous classes. Improvement on a national standardized conceptual test was also measured. This test is given at the beginning and the end of the semester and measures the improvement, or gain, of the class. The gain from previous classes and the online class were compared to see if changes that were made had a positive impact on the students' learning. The gain on the standardized assessment for the Fall 2019 class was 0.49 which is a significant improvement from the classes which were only required to state their answer and explanation (0.21 and 0.19). However, after statistical analysis was performed on the demographics of the students, it showed that there was a significant difference in the students' GPAs and their math ACT scores. This may have been a cause for the large gain.

At the USAF Academy, 36.4% of the cadets who intended to major in STEM before their first semester ended up graduating in a nonSTEM career. Because graduating cadets with STEM degrees is a priority for the Academy, this study investigated what factors were associated with cadets declaring STEM majors or switching out of them. Using archive datasets from the Registrar's Office in the Academic Year 2019-2020, 17 variables and 4,330 cadet data were analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistics. At the end of the academic year, 333 cadets went from undecided to selecting a major, 1,517 cadets reported a STEM major and, 1,731 cadets reported a nonSTEM major.

A total of 128 cadets (3.9%) switched majors during the academic year, with the most cadets switching majors within either STEM or nonSTEM. Twenty-four cadets (0.74%) switched out of STEM, and seven (0.22%) switched into STEM. Sophomores changed majors four times as much as juniors, with very few seniors doing so. STEM departers were more likely to have a low GPA and to come from a preparatory school, and were less likely to be scholars, international or ESL students. Cadets who went from undeclared to STEM majors were more likely to have higher Core GPA and SAT scores, and were less likely to participate in athletics.

Since relatively few cadets switch majors after declaring, retention efforts to keep cadets who intend to major in STEM from declaring a nonSTEM major should occur during their first year at the Academy.

Concept Mapping is a well-known technique that helps engage and deepen conceptual understanding, while providing meaningful connections in the classroom. A related technique, known as Concept Sketching, requires students to draw situations or models while including terms and definitions to help explain what is happening in their sketch. This approach engages students and enables them to demonstrate prior understanding while building on that knowledge as they learn more information on the topic.

It is hypothesized that when applying Concept Sketching in the classroom, higher overall assessment scores and greater improvement between pre- and post-test scores will be seen in student performance. The research is conducted using two sections of the same class, where both sections are introduced to Concept Sketches through the instructor drawing them on the board, but only one section is highly encouraged (and required at times) to use Concept Sketches in their studying and note taking habits.

In our results, the intervention group did show significant gains between pre and post testing, while the control group did not. However, even though the intervention group did have greater gains than the control group, the overall post test scores from each class were not significantly different. The introduction of Concept Sketching via our methods appears to have merit as an intervention, but more data needs to be collected to sufficiently support this conclusion.

Kentucky has the highest cancer incidence and mortality rates in the US. The greatest cancer burden lies in the Appalachian region (1, 2). These disparities are driven by social determinants of health (2, 3). Twenty-five youth participants of the University of Kentucky's Appalachian Career Training in Oncology (ACTION) Program created culturally-framed essays in which they described their experiences with cancer, their hypotheses as to why cancer rates are so high in Appalachian Kentucky, and potential solutions (4). We used content analysis to identify common themes within the essays, searching specifically for cancer types participants have observed, their feelings toward the causes of cancer, and their proposed solutions. The data show the participants observe lung, colon, breast and skin cancer, which are known to be elevated in the region. They believe high tobacco use, low education levels, and low health care access increase cancer rates. Solutions include increased cancer education, tobacco control, and better health care access/engagement. These observations and suggestions align with social determinants that drive the cancer rates. Through storytelling, we empowered youth to understand cancer through experiences and cultural framework. We also encouraged youth to brainstorm community-based intervention strategies that could reduce the cancer burden.

Athletes are indoctrinated with the idea that physical toughness is the key to success in their sport. But what about their mental toughness? This update a meta-analysis sought delve into this question. The researchers sought to determine if practicing mindfulness would be able to help improve both mental and physical aspects of athletic performance. Using PsycInfo and Academic Search Complete, we located 11 empirical studies that used some sort of mindfulness interventions to manipulate mental states and physical performance. Cohen's d effect size was computed from the data for each study.

Mindfulness interventions were found to have a strong effect on physical performance (d = 0.80), a small negative effect on negative emotional states, e.g., anxiety (d = -0.29, groups that received mindfulness interventions had lower anxiety), and a moderate positive effect on positive emotional states, e.g., flow (d = 0.59). Two studies combined emotional and physical exhaustion as the dependent variable, and mindfulness had a strong negative effect on this variable (d = -0.94). Overall, results indicate that mindfulness can play a beneficial role in sport psychology.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are increasingly common in our society; recent estimates of prevalent rates suggest that 1 in 59 children have some form of the disorder. ASD is characterized by deficits in social skills and communication, as well as engagement in stereotypical or repetitive behaviors. Could animals be the key to helping children with ASD improve these skills and behaviors? To answer this question, I searched Psycinfo and Google Scholar and located 17 studies that provided data about the effect animals have on children with ASD. The effect size (Cohen's d) was computed for each study. There was a great deal of variation in the effect sizes (range from 0.01 to 1.00), and a weighted average of d = 0.67, which reveals a weak-to-moderate effect, indicating that animals can have a positive effect on children with ASD. Further research is needed to determine the effects of specific moderators on this relationship.

There are very few members of “Generation Z” that do not have at least one social media account. And unfortunately, the rates of eating disorders are increasing, especially in the Gen Z population. Are these two things related? I sought to answer this research question by performing a meta-analysis. Using PsycInfo and Google Scholar, I located 12 studies that provided effect sizes for the relationship between social media use and disordered eating (total sample size N = 25,320). Effect sizes were found in each study and were converted to Cohen's d. A moderate relationship was found between the two variables (d = 0.70) such that people who use social media more have greater symptoms of disordered eating. The largest effect size (d = 2.25) was between FaceBook use and body dissatisfaction. This research is useful for parents, teachers, and counselors who work with the Gen Z population.

There are many factors influencing a student's academic performance, and anxiety comes up as one that negatively influences their grades. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to answer the research question “How strongly are anxiety and academic performance related? For this study, we conceptually combined negative internal states of mind, including anxiety, worry, and stress. We located 18 published studies (N = 86,251). The overall weighted correlation between anxiety/stress and academic performance is r = -.10, which is a small effect. However, the degree of stress is an important moderating variable. Studies that explicitly measured low levels of stress showed a small positive effect on academic performance (r = .08), whereas those that measured high levels of stress showed a small negative effect (r = -.06). These results suggest that some stress can enhance performance, but higher stress can negatively affect performance.

Ethnic minorities are often face discrimination, and this discrimination may cause them to have lowered well-being. However, a strong ethnic identity may be protective of well-being, and counterbalance some of the negative forces of being a minority member. This study sought to answer the question, “Does ethnic identity and effect well-being?” I located 20 articles (total sample size N = 5369) that varied in ethnic identity (African American, Asian-American, and Latin-American) and measured overall well-being. The articles were coded for the effect sizes (correlations for the relationship. The results of the study showed a small effect size of r = .16 between ethnic identity and well-being. The results showed that ethnic identity has a small effect size on overall well-being. However, further research should examine each ethnic identity separately to identify cultural differences that could further explain the results of well-being.

Mindfulness interventions have gained popularity in current literature; however, there is little research to show the implications such interventions may have in the healthcare field. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is worthwhile to evaluate these implications. The current study aims to investigate the relationship between mindfulness interventions and stress among healthcare workers. To assess the possible relation between mindfulness interventions and stress, we located 20 peer-reviewed studies published since 2015 that used a mindfulness intervention and measured stress responses in healthcare workers. Cohen's d effect size was computed for each studies' primary stress outcome. The results demonstrated a moderately strong effect size (d = -0.69) indicating that, on average, participants' stress declined in the presence of a mindfulness intervention compared to a control group. Working in healthcare can be stressful under normal circumstances and even more so during a pandemic; given the detrimental effects of stress on well-being and general health, mindfulness interventions may be a safeguard against stress and its effects.

Students from a variety of backgrounds often display an explicit lack of interest in working with the aging population. This lack of interest has been evidenced in students studying social work (Goncalves, et al., 2011). According to a report released in May 2010, it is predicted that by 2050, 88.5 million Americans will live to be 65 years of age or older and 21 million will live to be 85 years old or older (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2018). One in six Americans is projected to be 65 and older, with the most dramatic growth among those over age 85, elders of color, and women. These demographic changes will profoundly shape every aspect of our society. Given that older adults are the fastest growing segment of the population, both in the United States and around the world, students, regardless of their discipline or field, will come into contact with the aging population and their families. The purpose of the research were to (1) assess knowledge of and attitudes towards aging in a sample of undergraduate and graduate students undertaking, BSW and MSW degrees in social work, (2) analyze the extent to which knowledge, attitudes, perceptions of gerontological social work, and other factors are associated with interest of aging-related issues in working with aging populations, and, (3) provide the social work students with new educational materials to enhance their knowledge base regarding relevant gerontological issues.

It has been previously shown that different literature genres affect readers' recall performance and persuasion ratings (Muis et al., 2019; Zwaan, 1994). These studies had looked independently at genre, but not at interactions. The current study sought to investigate how genre type (persuasive, procedural, and narrative) might be most effective in promoting recall and also persuasion. Seventy-five undergraduate psychology students at Eastern Kentucky University participated in an online survey in which they were placed in one of the three literature genre conditions based around myths about COVID-19 and mask-wearing procedures. Participants first completed a reading engagement and health authority trust scale before reading their assigned condition. After reading the assigned text, participants completed recall questions and rated how influential they found the text to be. Our results indicated promising but not significant genre effects on recall and persuasion.

We examined how the interactions of grievance, status, and ideological factors (Right-Wing Authoritarianism, System Justification, and Social Dominance Orientation) influenced an individual's decision in the choice of peaceful or violent political protest. The current research sought to replicate and combine findings of different pieces of the previous literature on the subject. 97 undergraduate college students at Eastern Kentucky University agreed to participate in this study. Participants voluntarily read and responded to one of four randomly assigned vignettes that manipulated levels of grievance and status. Participants also completed the Social Dominance Orientation, Right-Wing Authoritarianism, and System Justification scales. We found support for one of our hypotheses – Right-Wing Authoritarianism was significantly negatively correlated in taking political action – and no support for our three other hypotheses. We believe that our vignettes may not have been dramatic enough to elicit dramatic responses from participants. Future research should look to present events of Covid-19 pandemic protests as well as the government shutdown of 2019 protests to understand what motivates an individual into action.

A representative sample of 120 members of the Berea College campus community completed an 80-item survey concerning identity, beliefs, perceptions, and judgments about Title IX and academic freedom as part of an Industrial/Organizational Psychology class project. This local, descriptive observational study included 20 ecologically valid scenarios. A strong negative correlation between the perception of hostile environments and academic freedom protection was found. Multiple regressions in a path analytic framework suggested that gender, a belief in activism, and support for hostile environment protection predicted an increased sensitivity to hostile environments. This perception, in turn, was the strongest predictor of judgments that actions described in the scenarios would not be protected by academic freedom. Ironically, academic freedom was only afforded when the respondent deemed the situation not to be hostile or offensive. Other results indicated that there was a substantial chill on campus and fear of backlash prevents many individuals from expressing opinions about sensitive issues. Information about student persistence and graduation suggested retention and graduation rates for conservative and male students were declining.

Behavior problems in childhood can result in undesired consequences during childhood and adolescence; however, do these behavior problems impact criminality later in life? The purpose of this meta-analysis was to explore this relationship. In order to evaluate this, we located 16 studies (N = 68,651) that reported correlations between child problem behaviors and arrests. We coded these articles and recorded the effect sizes (correlations) for the relationship. The result of this study showed a small effect size between Disruptive Behavior Disorder (DBD) and total arrests (r = .18), a medium effect size between conduct problems and total arrests (r = .32), a medium effect size between aggression and total arrests (r = .26), and a medium effect size between externalizing behaviors and total arrests (r = .39). These results suggest that arrests in adult life are influenced by DBD, conduct problems, aggression, and other externalizing behaviors in childhood.

Somewhere around 500,000 veterans experience PTSD, a mental disorder that can causes severe hardship and loss of quality of life, when they return from active duty. Standard treatments include both psychotherapy and medication, but are there other, more effective treatments? This research examines the effects of mindfulness-based interventions on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in active duty soldiers and/or veterans. This meta-analysis used 20 studies that compared a mindfulness-based intervention (i.e. mantra repetition, breathing-based, or meditation-based) to a control group or pretreatment condition. The standardized mean difference, d, was calculated for each study, and the weighted average effect size was computed for the set of studies. The overall effect of mindfulness-based interventions on PTSD symptoms was d = 0.62, which is a moderate effect. For the three most commonly reported PTSD symptoms, re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal, hyperarousal (d = 0.98) was impacted the most by the mindfulness-based intervention, followed by re-experiencing (d = 0.75) and avoidance (d = 0.57). These results suggest that mindfulness-based interventions are likely more effective in treating PTSD than other more commonly used interventions.

Time Perception is a very mutable attribute of our experience, but what factors can statistically be said to have an effect? Cognitive Load is particularly well-documented as a factor, to the point that the term has become somewhat nebulous, due to all the actors that can be considered a form of Cognitive Load. The purpose of this research was to dissect the identified pieces of Cognitive Load as a concept as they affect Time Perception. In order to evaluate these relationships, we sampled 20 recent studies from the database PsycINFO that identified a relationship between what can be construed as a form of Cognitive Load and Time Perception. The overall observed effect was large (d = 0.76), and we coded for several moderator variables. These include emotional/affective load as well as memory demands, both of which were found to have a large effect (d = 0.74, d = 1.45 respectively).

Each year, the primary goal of the Neuroscience outreach program is to disseminate science information and promote brain health in the community through lectures and presentations of research outcomes. This year, we exceeded our goal to reach over 1500 people through visits to schools (9th-12th grades), a brain drawing contest (K-12th grades), and the Kentucky Brain Bee (9th-12th grades). In previous years, school visits were made to grades from elementary to high school (4th-12th), but this year's school visits were limited to high schools in January-March and couldn't be extended to elementary and middle schools. School visits included lectures that focused on the effects of drugs on brain function and behavior, as well as presentations on the outcomes of brain research. The Brain Drawing Contest is designed to enhance brain awareness among students (K-12th), through collaborative efforts in the community—among teachers, parents, and administrators in four counties. This year, we received over 450 entries with themes specific to each grade. Judging was done in January and February by eight student judges, seven faculty members from different disciplines, and a community representative. Judging was based on originality, scientific accuracy, and overall design. The Kentucky Brain Bee was held successfully in early February. Continuing participation and support from the community reflects an impact of our Neuroscience outreach program in our service region. Supported by the Kentucky Academy of Science Grant.

During the COVID-19 global pandemic, many Americans were forced to work from home. Speculation has been made about the job satisfaction felt by those whom have been working at home, but very few research studies have surfaced on this subject. This study used a survey to investigate the relationship among demographic characteristics, job characteristics, and the job satisfaction of the individuals working from home. We used a 7-point Likert scale to measure job satisfaction. We suspect there will be differences in job satisfaction based on the demographic and job characteristics. We are collecting data from 1000 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers who are paid .25 to complete a survey. Multiple correlations between the demographic data, the job characteristics and job satisfaction will be determined. Additionally, quasi-analyses for age groups, gender, and the presence of children at home on job satisfaction will be performed. It is suspected that gender and age groups will have differential effects on job satisfaction. The application for these findings may suggest that companies should not have a work from home or non-work from home policy, but companies should consider demographic factors and job factors before instituting such a policy.

In recent years, greater attention has been paid to aversive childhood experiences and their impact on later functioning. Cumulative exposure to toxic stress has been associated with increased risk in both physical and mental health domains, as well as in parenting (Hays-Grudo & Wilson, 2020). The present study explores connections between parents' sensitivity/synchrony scores on The Toddler CARE-Index (TCI: Crittenden, 2007) and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) in parent and child. As part of a larger longitudinal study of Eastern Kentucky families, 21 children (mean age 4.5 years) and their parents participated in the Strange Situation (Ainsworth, Blehar, & Waters, 1978). This separation-reunion procedure places caregivers under some stress. Highly synchronous parents, however, modify their behavior to stay consistently sensitive to their child's needs. When the children averaged 16 years of age, they were administered the Transition to Adulthood Attachment Interview (TAAI; Crittenden, 2006), and parents completed the Life Experiences Questionnaire (LEQ; Cowen et al., 1990). Both were coded for ACEs, for example, divorce, parental substance use, etc. Coding is nearly complete, and the authors hypothesize that parents who were exposed to more adverse life events will: a) show less synchrony with their child at age 4.5; and b) have children who were also exposed to more adverse life events. Many of our dyads received low synchrony scores, indicating a lack of emotional attunement with their children and a need for early intervention. If our hypotheses are supported, findings will suggest a role for synchrony/sensitivity in the intergenerational transmission of risk.

Social distancing and COVID-19 have permeated every aspect of society, including psychological practice. Given this, teleassessment has become increasingly salient for both practitioners and clients alike. An important question is, ‘Is assessment of psychological disorders via teleassessment equivalent to assessments done live in face-to-face settings?’ We have conducted a meta-analysis examining the item-level comparison of administrations of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, 2nd Edition (ADOS-2) in teleassessment versus face-to-face assessment procedure. Using academic databases, we identified six empirical studies reporting percent agreement (PA) for ADOS-2 module 1 and 4 items. We were able to compare this empirical data to the ADOS-2 Manual, which also reports percent agreements for all items. The ADOS-2 manual clearly outperforms face-to-face assessments. However, the teleassessment procedure PAs were equivalent or better than face-to-face assessments. Module 4, teleassessment was equivalent to the ADOS-2 validation sample with slight variation. This study found that ADOS-2 teleassessment procedures demonstrated approximately equivalent PAs as the initial ADOS-2 face-to-face validation sample.

Parental sensitivity is critical in the development of children's attachment to their caregivers. Sensitivity refers to a parent's ability to understand and react in accordance with their child's emotions. Covert hostility is a specific type of insensitivity in which parents are subtly dismissing. The current study examines both parenting constructs during a delayed gratification task, in relation to child behavior in an emotion interview. Specifically, as part of a larger longitudinal study, 35 children (average age 6 years) and their parents waited eight minutes for children to be permitted to open a bag of prizes. We coded parental behavior in fifteen-second intervals for sensitivity and covert hostility in response to their child's cues. Sensitive parents responded in ways that would help their children wait effectively, while covertly hostile parents were impatient or teased their child. Our ratings were based upon guidelines in the Emotional Availability Scale (Biringen, 2000). A separate task involved the children discussing their experiences with six emotions. This interview was coded on 4 point scales indicating children's level of engagement and adaptive regulation of their emotions and behavior. Although coding of parenting is ongoing, we hypothesize that caregivers with higher levels of sensitivity, and lower levels of covert hostility, will have children with greater emotion regulation capacities in the interview. Our coding thus far indicates a dearth of sensitive parenting during a task that should elicit it. If the expected associations are detected, this will have implications for children's adjustment as well as for parenting interventions.

Background: According to the 2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 54.9 percent of college students drank alcohol in the past month, and 36.9 percent engaged in heavy episodic drinking. With over half of college students drinking alcohol, research understanding alcohol-related problems in this population is vital. Previous research suggests that emotion regulation may be associated with alcohol use and related problems. The present study expanded upon this line of work and examined facets of emotion regulation difficulties in relation to alcohol-related problems.

Method: Participants were 382 college students (79% female, 76% Caucasian, mean age = 19.45 years, SD = 3.03) who completed online measures that assessed emotion regulation difficulties, alcohol use frequency, and alcohol- related problems. Emotion regulation difficulties were measured using the validated Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) which is made up of six subscales.

Results: In a linear regression model, a significant effect was found between the six DERS subscales, level of drinking, and alcohol-related problems, (F(6, 343) = 25.73, p < .000, R2 = .31). The individual predictors were examined further and indicated that only one subscale, difficulty engaging in goal-directed behavior (t = 3.52, p < .000) was a significant predictor.

Discussion: These results underscore the importance of emotion regulation, specifically the ability to engage in goal-directed behavior, in the context of understanding alcohol-related problems. Intervention and prevention efforts aimed at enhancing goal-directed behavior may reduce alcohol-related problems in college students.

Sidewalks that do not abide by safety regulations can pose a serious safety issue for individuals that use them. More specifically, sidewalk gaps that do not conform to regulation standards could become fall hazards for pedestrians. In this study, we investigated the size of sidewalk gaps that could endanger pedestrians that use rollator walkers. Various sidewalk gap width and depth sizes were tested using a rollator walker with wheels six-inch in diameter. Our results indicated that sidewalk gaps that do not conform to regulation standards significantly increase the likelihood of a fall incident.

Age-related decline in emotion recognition is observed when people categorize emotional faces using Ekman's universal categories. The current study asked adults (n = 234) aged 20 to 77 years (M = 48.1, SD = 16.3) to label the emotion observed in images of inanimate objects with visual cues resembling faces. Participants also performed a forced-choice emotion categorization for each stimulus applying Ekman's universal categories. Cognitive measures of working memory, verbal ability, and processing speed were administered. Contrary to expectations, advancing age was not associated with an emotion perception deficit. Older individuals, given a higher level of verbal ability, offered a wider range of emotion labels when freely labeling stimuli, suggesting a tendency to engage in a more nuanced appraisal of emotion in faces. However, age was not associated with one's likelihood to offer emotion labels consistent with Ekman's universal categories. When choosing from a set of possible emotion labels for each stimulus, participants generally agreed upon a single universal emotion category with more precision than when freely labeling emotion. In fact, participants were as likely to offer an emotion label that did not fit into a universal emotion category as they were to offer one that did. Emotion recognition tasks that ask people to select from specific categories force people to consider universal labels that they may not otherwise offer when asked simply to describe the emotion. These findings suggest that research on emotion perception underestimates the breadth of older adults' appraisals of emotion in others.

Elementary, middle, and secondary teachers are leaving the profession at an alarming rate. As a result, many classrooms are being staffed with underqualified teachers, and students' academic performance is adversely affected. Multiple years of ineffective teaching creates a negative cumulative effect on students' academic performance which can result in potentially insurmountable learning deficits for many students.

One of the possible causes of teacher turnover is ineffective leadership. To investigate this hypothesis, we located eleven empirical studies that assessed the relationship between leadership behaviors and teacher turnover (total sample size N = 36,550). We found that overall leadership and retention rates are only moderately related, r = .23. However, we did determine that some specific leadership types seem to be more effective. For example, transformational leadership and retention rate were strongly related, r = .42. Interpersonal skills and retention rate were also quite strongly related, r = .57. Unfortunately, the research is still fractured, and we are unable to test important moderator variables like gender and location. This is a topic that definitely warrants further research.

Autonomous vehicles require drivers to monitor a primary task (driving) while potentially focusing on a secondary task; if the car's automation failed, the driver would have to effectively take over driving. Using a dual task methodology, we analyzed performance (latency and accuracy) for a secondary task presented either visually or auditorily. We hypothesized that the tracking task would impair performance on the secondary task and would have differential effects depending on secondary task type. For the secondary task, addition and subtraction problems and answers were presented. The participants (N = 24, female) had to decide if the answer was correct or incorrect. For the tracking task, a cursor moved over a square containing a smaller target area where the cursor stayed while in automatic. When automation failed, the cursor deviated from the target, moving randomly. The participant was required to move the cursor back to the target area while performing the secondary task. A significant secondary task difference for latency, F(1, 22) = 74.3, p.<.01, was observed (auditory > visual). No significant differences between single and dual task conditions for secondary task performance were found. The latency difference between auditory and visual problems could have been caused by 1.) Higher familiarity with visual arithmetic problems, 2.) Requirement of more mental resources to interpret auditory arithmetic problems. The lack of differences in secondary task performance implies that participants applied the same amount of mental resources to the secondary task as the single-task condition. This could have negative implications for autonomous vehicles. Limitations discussed.

Computer-generated speech is becoming more commonplace in classrooms, so it is important to examine the impact of computer voice effect on students' cognitive effort and recall performance. Some studies have examined how voice-rendering type (human, classic computer voice, and modern computer voice) affect cognitive effort and recall, but most of these studies include some form of visual aid and do not focus solely on voice effect. The current study investigated participants' recall performance and effort ratings of an audio agent when the information is presented by either a classic audio engine, a modern audio engine, or a human voice. In an online setting, participants were placed under cognitive stress by being presented with a 5-digit number to memorize for 15 seconds and then instructed to listen to an audio lecture divided into three segments. Each segment of the audio lecture was presented by a different voice. Participants were asked to recall the 5-digit number after each lecture segment. Then participants rated their effort on each segment's task. Lastly, participants answered free recall and multiple-choice questions about the content of the audio lecture. The findings indicated that voice-type had a medium-size effect on effort. Participants rated the classic voice as demanding the most effort and the human voice demanding the least effort. Participants also had the best recall performance in the human voice condition and the worst recall performance in the classic voice condition. These findings have important implications for the design of voice assistants, screen readers, or educational materials.

Recent research findings related to self-rapport indicated that it might be more beneficial to conduct interviews online as the interviewee is more comfortable and is able to disclose more personal information (Jenner & Myers, 2019). There is, however, a lack of research in the comparison of communication method as measured by participant engagement. The purpose of the current study is to see if there is a significant difference in engagement level between: 1) interacting with an individual in person; and 2) through an online video call. In the current study engagement is measured by self-assessment and recall performance. Researchers interviewed participants in a controlled laboratory setting either through an online video call (Skype Business) or an in-person interview. After participants had completed the interviews, they were given an engagement survey and memory recall test about personal information the researcher disclosed during the interview. Our results showed that participants felt more attentive when interacting with the interviewer through the face-to-face session compared to the online video call. Results from the study also showed that even though participants were more attentive in the face-to-face session, participants were more willing to disclose personal information during the online video call. The current findings can be used in distance education settings to improve teachers-pupil interaction.

People and animals depend heavily upon vision in everyday life; indeed, survival itself depends upon the effective functioning of sensory systems. One important purpose of vision is to permit an animal or person to perceive the shapes of environmental objects. While many studies have investigated the visual perception of shape, few have evaluated whether and to what extent aging affects shape discrimination performance. Given that aging is known to affect sensory systems, it is important to evaluate the potential effects of aging upon visual shape perception. In this study, 28 younger and older adults (mean age of the younger adults was 19.0 years, while that of the older adults was 70.4 years) viewed 15 × 15 (225) arrays of texture elements. In the background, each texture element (3.5 mm long) was composed of three collinear points. The foreground object to be judged was defined only by a difference in texture. The foreground texture elements were also formed from three points; the deviation from collinearity varied from 20 to 80 degrees. The object defined by the foreground texture elements was either a horizontally or vertically-oriented rectangle. The participants' task on each trial (3 second stimulus duration) was to indicate whether the texture-defined rectangle was horizontal or vertical. The results indicated that the younger adults' shape discrimination performance was more than twice as high as that exhibited by the older adults. The current study demonstrates that aging has large and adverse effects upon the human ability to perceive shape from texture.

Parental reflective functioning (RF) is the ability to understand children's behavior in terms of underlying mental states (Slade et al., 2005). RF has a demonstrated relationship with child attachment, but less is known about the relationship between a parent's reflective functioning skill and their own attachment strategy. This study, part of a larger longitudinal project of Eastern Kentucky families, assessed RF in the parents of 21 families when the children averaged 12 years of age. Specifically, a 7-point scale was used to rate RF in an interview in which parents discussed their child's thoughts, emotions, and behaviors during Word Making and Make A Speech About Yourself tasks. Parent attachment strategies were coded from the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI: George, Kaplan, & Main, 1985; Crittenden & Landini, 2011), an hour-long interview in which parents are asked about their childhood relationships with their parents and the impacts those relationships have. Attachment was examined as high-risk, reflecting increased information processing errors and inflexibility, vs. low risk. For example, one type of high risk insecure attachment involves idealizing harmful or neglectful parents. While we expected caregivers with high-risk insecure attachment would have lower reflective functioning than caregivers with lower risk status, our results unfortunately do not support this. Overall, RF ratings for our parents were fairly low, and these were not substantially different between the groups of caregivers. Lack of statistical power and methodological challenges will be discussed as possible limitations.

Fluctuation in temperatures due to climate change could have a direct effect on the fitness and metabolism, or aerobic scope (AS) of fish. Aerobic scope represents the difference in the fish's maximum metabolic rate [MMR] and their standard metabolic rate [SMR]. We have conducted a series of tests on adults of a Kentucky native stream minnow, Pimephales notatus, to monitor their metabolic responses (SMR and MMR) under four thermal conditions (13°C, 18°C, 23°C, and 28°C). Fish metabolism was determined using a static-flow respirometry system with optical dissolved oxygen detection to determine oxygen consumption rates. Fish mass (0.01 g) measurements allow for the determination of mass-specific metabolic rates of each fish. Having an understanding of fish metabolic performance across a range of thermal conditions will allow us to determine how plastic this species is to potential changes in environmental conditions in a future warmer climate, and give us some insight into whether this species will be able to maintain its position within the Kentucky stream fish community.

Fishes of the Wild River section of the Red River (between KY 746 and KY 715) were surveyed at eight sites (approximately 200 m each) in the late summer to mid-fall of 2019. Most of the Wild River section has never been surveyed for fishes. Fishes were sampled by both backpack electrofishing and seining, with the goal of determining the fish community makeup and health of the surveyed region. Captured fishes were identified and counted; these data were analyzed using the Kentucky Index of Biotic Integrity (KIBI) to determine fish community health. A total number of 4,103 individuals were encountered, comprising 41 total species. Five of these species were newly recorded in this section of the Red River. KIBI scores ranged from 67 to 90, in the high end of “Good” to “Excellent” categories. The lower end of the study area, below a series of category II-III rapids, was particularly diverse in fishes. Sites there had the highest KIBI scores (84-90), high species richness (29-32), and high numbers of darter, madtom, and sculpin species (12-14), a group of fishes especially sensitive to environmental disturbances. Comparison with historical collections suggest the fish community of this area is stable. Our analysis indicates the fish fauna is nearly undisturbed, an uncommon condition of small rivers in Kentucky.

A large part of wilderness stewardship in Kentucky's natural areas is devoted to trail maintenance. Understanding the use of trails by both humans and larger mammals is important to determine the best planning for maintenance of the trails and surrounding habitat. Recently, trail counters have become a popular tool to estimate visitor-use levels in parks. Although commercial trail devices are available, none are able to meet our requirements due to expense and limited functions. We have developed a low-cost smart trail device with automated monitoring and data recording functions in order to gather baseline information on differential trail usage by humans / large mammals as affected by time of day, season, and weather conditions, etc. We test the hypothesis that trails not commonly frequented by humans, have higher deer and other large mammals use which could reduce encroaching dense underbrush on trails. Therefore, by using this device, one can plan where maintenance should be focused, saving organizations time and money. This low-cost smart trail device includes an ATmega328P microcontroller, an infrared sensor, SD card (memory), a temperature and humidity combined environmental sensor, OLED display, on-board buttons, LED's, and battery, etc. A 3D-printed enclosure was created using SolidWorks and used to protect all the electronic components, circuitry, and battery from outdoor harsh environment. The hardware and software have been designed, developed, and tested. The result has shown that this smart trail device is able to capture real-time trail usage data and store it into the SD card for further data analysis.
