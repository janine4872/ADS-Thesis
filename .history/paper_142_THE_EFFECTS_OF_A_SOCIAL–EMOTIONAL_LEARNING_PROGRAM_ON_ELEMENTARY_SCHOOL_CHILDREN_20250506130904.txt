Abstract
This quasi-experimental exploratory study investigated whether a social–emotional learning program, implemented during a 1-year period, could lead to gains in social–emotional competencies and a reduction in internalizing and externalizing problems. Furthermore, it showed which pupils would benefit most from the program. The program was applied to 213 fourth-grade Portuguese pupils. One hundred five controls followed an Origami curriculum during the same period. Sixteen teachers also participated in this study. Self-report (pupils) and hetero-report (teachers) questionnaires were administered before and after the intervention. There were significant intervention gains in some social–emotional competencies, namely, peer relations and social competence, but no gains were found in internalizing and externalizing problems. Intervention pupils with average pre-test scores profited more in self-management and peer relations than controls. Boys showed greater gains in self-management, aggressiveness, and social problems than girls. There were no significant differences regarding socioeconomic status.

The current demands of society require additional skills from children, such as being socially and emotionally competent, in order to adapt themselves to the complex demands of growth and development (Payton et al., 2000) and to attain successful adult lives. This is the main reason the marketplace is crowded with school-based programs geared toward addressing children's social and emotional development (Greenberg et al., 2003; Zins, Bloodworth, Weissberg, & Walberg, 2004).

However, schools have limited resources, time constraints, and competing demands, such as enhancing academic performance, so educators must prioritize and effectively implement evidence-based approaches (Durlak, Weissberg, Dymnicki, Taylor, & Schellinger, 2011). Additionally, many well-intentioned programs used by schools lack a strong research framework, are not necessarily effective, or schools use them with poor fidelity (Durlak et al., 2011; Merrell & Buchanan, 2006; Weissberg, Kumpfer, & Seligman, 2003). Also, as they have been mainly implemented in the United States (Durlak et al., 2011; Zeidner, Roberts, & Matthews, 2002), it remains unclear to what degree they are appropriate for pupils in other national or cultural contexts (Diekstra, 2008; Weare & Gray, 2003; Zeidner, Roberts, & Matthews, 2002). Moreover, there are few studies in the literature that analyze how pupils’ characteristics might moderate the impact of these interventions, and some of them present contradictory results (Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group [CPPRG], 2010; Durlak et al., 2011; Greenberg, Domitrovich, & Bumbarger, 2001). Even fewer studies isolate the manner and attitude in which staff interact with children (Brown, Jones, LaRusso, & Aber, 2010; Diekstra, 2008; Greenberg, Kusche, Cook, & Quamma, 1995).

Therefore, the main purpose of this research was to examine the efficacy of a social–emotional learning (SEL) program on social–emotional competencies and on the psychological adjustment of Portuguese elementary school children, as well as the moderating role of pupils’ characteristics (such as pre-test behavioral outcomes, gender, and socioeconomic status [SES]) in this process, after controlling for staff characteristics by having the same trainer implementing a non-SEL program in the control group.

SEL Programs
The focus of most SEL programs is universal prevention and promotion, that is, preventing behavioral problems by promoting social–emotional competence (Zins & Elias, 2006). Although SEL may encompass many aspects, the primary elements include development of self-awareness and self-management skills to achieve school and life success; use of social awareness and interpersonal skills to establish and maintain positive relationships; demonstration of decision-making skills; and responsible behaviors in personal, school, and community contexts (Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning [CASEL], 2003). A recent meta-analysis focused exclusively on SEL programs (Durlak et al., 2011) showed that, compared with pupils in the control groups, those participating in universal SEL programs, aged between 5 and 18 years, significantly improved social–emotional competencies; attitudes about self, others, and school; pro-social behaviors; and academic performance. In addition, conduct and internalizing problems decreased. The impact of SEL interventions was similar to or, in some cases, higher than those achieved by other types of universal interventions aimed at preventing behavioral and social–emotional problems and promoting mental health, positive youth development, and academic achievement (Catalano, Berglung, Ryan, Lonczak, & Hawkins, 2002; Greenberg et al., 2001; Wilson & Lipsey, 2007), in each outcome category, especially for SEL skills.

The SEL evidence base suggests that successful programs should be both well designed and well conducted (Durlak et al., 2011), that is, be developmentally and culturally appropriate, promote generalization of newly learned skills (CASEL, 2003; Durlak et al., 2011; Greenberg et al., 2003; Payton et al., 2000; Weissberg et al., 2003; Zins et al., 2004), include a written manual specifying the conceptual model and the intervention procedures of the program (Diekstra, 2008), and adhere to sequenced, active, focused, and explicit (SAFE) practices, that is, ensure that the program uses a coordinated sequence of activities and active forms of learning, devotes sufficient time and attention to social–emotional skill development, and has clear and specific SEL objectives (Durlak et al., 2011). Successful SEL programs also have a high level of structure and consistency in program delivery and are carefully monitored to ensure that they are delivered as intended by their developers (Humphrey, Lendrum, & Wigelsworth, 2010). To achieve this, interventions must begin with efficacy trials, move on to effectiveness studies, and finally end with broad dissemination trials (Flay et al., 2005). The present study is a quasi-experimental exploratory efficacy trial of a monitored SEL program. Some recent studies in the United Kingdom showed that when proper trialing is skipped and interventions are immediately rolled out on a national level, interventions may fail to significantly impact pupils’ behavioral and academic outcomes (Hallam, 2009; Humphrey, Lendrum et al., 2010).

The “Slowly but Steadily” Program
“Slowly but Steadily” is a universal program that draws concepts and techniques from the SEL framework by integrating competence-promotion and youth-development frameworks (Durlak et al., 2011) and is devised on the basis of best evidence on “what works.” It is classroom-based and infused into the school curriculum, and has aimed at developing social–emotional competencies, enhancing psychological adjustment and fostering academic performance by preventing or reducing behavioral and emotional problems in elementary school children. This program is based on the notion that social–emotional skills can be learned and taught in school, and that they require explicit instruction just like academic skills (Zins et al., 2004). Slowly but Steadily is a comprehensive program that emphasizes not only the teaching of skills, but also how to apply them to meaningful real-life situations facilitate their generalization. It consists of 21 developmentally appropriate 45- to 60-minute sessions, delivered weekly by school psychologists in the teachers’ presence, over one school year, with a sequenced set of activities that emphasize learning by doing and by interactive and reflexive experiences. The Slowly but Steadily curriculum is based on a number of theoretical models, namely, the social and emotional competence framework (Denham, Wyatt, Bassett, Echeverria, & Knox, 2009), the ABCD (affective, behavioral, cognitive, dynamic) model of development (Greenberg et al., 1995), the bio-ecological model (Brofenbrenner & Morris, 2006), and the social learning theory (Bandura, 1977). The program is structured according to the premise that social and emotional competence is based on a dynamic integration of emotions, behavior, and cognitions (the ABCD model of development) and that children cope by enhancing self- and social awareness, self-managing emotions, and using relationship skills and social problem-solving skills (social and emotional competence framework).

The program manual contains session plans, with SEL learning objectives, techniques, and strategies to be implemented, materials to be used, and a description of the activities for each session (Raimundo, 2007). The techniques and strategies used include didactic instruction, posters, storytelling activities, reflection/brainstorming underlying the most efficient strategies with open-ended questioning, modeling (through observation and imitation; Bandura, 1977), role playing, constructive feedback, social and self-reinforcement, and group games. Skill concepts are typically presented via didactic instruction, storytelling activities, posters, and modeling. Sometimes, group games are used without prior explicit mention of the concepts to get children more involved and ready to integrate skill concepts. Reflection/brainstorming, role playing, constructive feedback, and social and self-reinforcement follow, giving children a chance to practice the skill with the trainer monitoring the level of understanding and skill attained and allowing teachers to learn “on the job” how to develop social–emotional competencies and to generalize their new competencies to others classes, allowing for an enhancement in the school microsystem impact (Brofenbrenner & Morris, 2006). Finally, teachers are encouraged to promote generalization of those competencies during the week by reminding pupils throughout the day to use them (especially before recess). The curriculum is divided into five units, each containing developmentally sequenced sessions to integrate and build on previous learning to give children a global vision of social–emotional competencies (Table 1). We hypothesized that this program would lead to larger gains in social–emotional competencies and in the psychological adjustment of intervention pupils compared with non-intervention controls (Hypothesis 1).

Table 1. Structure and Content of the Slowly but Steadily Program
Unit	Sessions	Description of One Example of an Activity
Self-awareness, understanding, and communication of emotions	25% of the curriculum; 6 activities	“Emotions Game”–Children receive cards that have a word describing an emotion on them, which the children have to enact to members of their group, who then have to guess the emotion. Emotions are taught in a developmental hierarchy, beginning with basic emotions and proceeding to more complex emotional states. Whenever necessary, the trainer models emotions. During the game, with the trainer's help, children try to reveal the internal cues that identify feelings in oneself and the external cues that identify feelings in others. Children are also made aware of the slight differences in those cues or in the intensity of the expression, which may correspond to different emotions (e.g. furious, irritated, and annoyed).
Social awareness, perspective taking, and empathy	20% of the curriculum; 4 activities	“Being Different”–Consists of reading testimonies from a book, written by children of the same age, describing their brothers and sisters who have some kind of disability. A reflection follows the reading, focused on the similarities and differences the children may have with them; the particularities of each person that make him or her different from everybody else; how everyone can be incapable of doing something, even temporarily; and how one feels when being discriminated against.
Emotion regulation (self-management)	25% of the curriculum; 3 activities	“Let's Overcome Bad Feelings”–Consists of reading a short story that involves a social situation and asking children to label the most salient emotion. Children are then encouraged to describe situations in which they have felt the same and to tell how their body reacted, how they felt, what they thought, what they did, and what the consequences of their actions were. This is followed by a brainstorming session, in which the most efficient strategies on how to deal with certain emotions are underlined and written on the board. The same activity is then repeated with other emotions and social situations.
Interpersonal skills, peer communication (assertiveness), and managing conflicts	25% of the curriculum; 6 activities	Group games, in which children have to work together to achieve the main goal of each game, are the focus of this unit. A reflection session on the need to work together, the individual responsibility of each group, and the importance of good communication skills follows, as well as role playing, in which children have to implement communication skills to negotiate a conflict situation.
Responsible decision-making and problem-solving skills	5% of the curriculum; 2 activities	This last unit is also approached during the previous units. After reading a story in which the steps to make a responsible decision are exemplified and reinforced by direct instruction, including considering all relevant factors and the likely consequences of alternative courses of action, children are encouraged to work in groups and to try to apply what they have learned. Examples of situations in their everyday lives, involving decisions to be made, are presented on cards, discussed in groups, and written on worksheets. The conclusions of each group are then presented to the class.
The Role of Pupils’ Characteristics
There is a substantial knowledge base supporting the potential of school-based interventions to positively impact behavioral and academic outcomes by significantly reducing problems and increasing competencies (Catalano et al., 2002; Greenberg et al., 2001); however, we still know little about how pupils’ characteristics are related to differential program benefits (Durlak et al., 2011).

In a study involving a clustered randomized controlled trial of the universal SEL program, Fast Track PATHS Curriculum, the intervention effect was stronger for the aggressiveness of pupils in elementary school whose aggression problems were rated (by teacher report) as being worse initially and for the social competence of pupils in schools with fewer socioeconomic disadvantages. Also, peer report effects regarding aggressive, hyperactive-disruptive and pro-social behaviors were moderated by gender, with significant positive effects only for boys (CPPRG, 2010). However, this study did not assess the universal intervention alone; it also included a selected intervention, and schools at extreme levels of pupil poverty had a substantially higher rate of child turnover. A quasi-experimental design test of the UK Resilience Program among seventh-grade pupils, a universal intervention focusing on improving resilience and promoting accurate thinking, showed similar results for internalizing self-report problems: the impact was greater for pupils with worse initial scores for symptoms of depression and anxiety, but was greater (anxiety) for the more disadvantaged pupils (Challen, Noden, West, & Machin, 2010). In a randomized controlled trial study of the PATHS school-based SEL curriculum, delivered by elementary school teachers, Greenberg and colleagues (1995) found that children high in both internalizing and externalizing problems showed the most significant improvements in the ability to express and change emotions. A quasi-experimental test of the Unique Minds School Program, a universal prevention teacher-led program designed to promote cognitive–social–emotional skills on elementary school pupils, showed no differences due to gender in the program's positive effects on pupils’ self-efficacy, problem solving, social–emotional competencies and math grades (Linares et al., 2005). Finally, in a quasi-experimental exploratory study of the Responsive Classroom Approach intended to promote a caring classroom environment for children and to integrate social and academic learning, Rimm-Kaufman and Chiu (2007) concluded that the intervention was equally effective for children from “at-risk” (poverty, single-parent status, low maternal education, limited English proficiency) and not-at-risk backgrounds regarding social and academic domains.

Taken together, research suggests that our understanding of the moderating variables that influence the effects of the programs is still obscure (Durlak et al., 2011; Greenberg et al., 2001; Weissberg et al., 2003), with studies showing contradictory results regarding gender and SES. Additionally, given the reasonable assumption that staff qualities and characteristics, and the way in which they interact with pupils, can have a strong impact, one of the most compelling questions in SEL efficacy research and practice is still far from being answered, because one cannot be sure whether the positive results are due to the interventions or to unmeasured characteristics of the staff who delivered the programs (Brown et al., 2010; Diekstra, 2008; Greenberg et al., 1995).

In the current study, we addressed these additional issues by examining whether children (boys and girls) with varying levels of social–emotional competencies and behavior problems, and from different socioeconomic backgrounds, are differently affected by the program, which is delivered by the same school psychologist to the intervention group, while another (non-SEL) program is also implemented by the same trainer to all control children. We hypothesized that this program would lead to a great reduction in aggressiveness and anxiety among those pupils showing the highest pre-test levels (Hypothesis 2). We also formulated the following research questions (a) Do pupils with low social–emotional competencies profit better? (b) Do boys reveal more gains than girls? (c) Do pupils from low SES exhibit more gains than pupils from high SES?

Method
Research Design
Data were collected as part of a longitudinal study using a cohort-sequential design. The research design was a 2 (interventions vs. control) × 3 (pre vs. post vs. follow-up test), which could be considered quasi-experimental, as sampling was not totally random and not all school/class effects could be controlled. Both groups were tested and re-tested under the same conditions. The current study examined only program effects shortly after the implementation (2 × 2 pre–post intervention/control design).

Participants
Three hundred eighteen (175 boys, 143 girls) fourth-grade pupils (Mage = 9.31; SD = .56) from six Portuguese primary state schools in Lisbon participated in this study; 213 in intervention groups (11 classes) and 105 in control groups (five classes). Fourth grade is the last year in Portuguese elementary schools. Sixteen teachers (11 from intervention classes and 5 from control classes) were also part of the sample. The total number of pupils per class ranged from 17 to 25 (M = 20.13). The SES was somewhat heterogeneous, but predominantly middle class. Schools varied slightly in ethnicity (most minorities were black/African Portuguese, with some Eastern Europe, Asian, and gipsy). Three schools (nine classes) had pupils from middle-income and non-ethnically diverse populations, and the other three (seven classes) had pupils from low- to middle-income and ethnically diverse populations. Almost half of these children's parents had finished high school and/or obtained higher education (47%). No gender, X2(1) = .445, p = .51, or age, F(1, 316) = .244, p = .622, differences were found between intervention and control groups, but the intervention groups (M SES = 3.23; SD = 1.32) had a higher SES, F(1, 294) = 10.254, p < .01, than the control groups (M SES = 3.75; SD = 1.13). Also, as gender significantly affected treatment outcomes we included gender and SES as covariates in all subsequent analyses.

Procedure and Program Implementation
Six school head teachers were invited to participate in the study. Only one school refused to participate due to its commitment to another program. Interviews with teachers and heads were conducted to understand the behavioral and social characteristics of the groups, as well as school functioning and organization. During the first intervention year, the developmental and cultural suitability of program contents and activity types were analyzed, as well as the social validity of the prototype program, that is, the social importance and acceptability of the program goals, procedures, and outcomes (Merrell, 2010). One measure, geared toward evaluating the intervention, was adapted to the Portuguese context. A training manual was prepared for the program beforehand, and daily records were kept to evaluate implementation quality. After evaluating the program's feasibility during the first-year pilot study, some program content and activities were changed, the instrument was improved, and the sample broadened.

All six schools contacted in the first year agreed to participate in the formal efficacy trial during the second year of implementation. Class teachers and school heads were invited to individual meetings. Due to practical and ethical issues, it was not possible to randomly assign participants to the intervention or control conditions. Two schools did not want to introduce different instructional practices between pupils, so they only agreed to intervention classes, whereas another only had one fourth-grade class, so only three of the six schools had control classes. Control classes were randomly selected. The groups were matched as much as possible in terms of catchment area. The program took place during school hours as part of the curriculum. Weekly sessions were supported by a school psychologist with practice in group intervention with fourth-grade children, with the help of two undergraduate psychology students, in the teachers’ presence. The control children received an Origami (Japanese art of folding paper) program, at the same time as the intervention, introduced by the same psychologist, in the teachers’ presence, to reduce practice and Hawthorne effects. No SEL contents were explicitly developed in these groups.

Letters were sent home to inform parents of the nature and purpose of the study. Of the six schools in the evaluation, two utilized active informed consent and four utilized passive informed consent because the program was already accepted as part of the school curriculum, following national legislation. Verbal assent was obtained from children. No incentives for participation were provided.

Multimethod, multiagent assessments were gathered at baseline, post-test, and 1-year follow-up. The measures were administered by the researcher to intervention and control children and teachers during the second (after a first presentation session) and last sessions of the program, with a pre–post period of 8 months. The questionnaire instructions were read out loud to children, as they completed it, to lessen the effects of reading skills on their understanding of the items. The same class teachers completed three questionnaires for each pupil to provide some control for differences in perceptions. In one intervention, the class teacher was replaced during the school year, so this teacher's pre- and post-test questionnaires were not included. In two control classes, teachers did not fill in the post-test questionnaires, so the pre-tests were withdrawn. Teachers’ questionnaires were retrieved by the third session (pre-test) and 2 weeks after delivering the program (post-test). Comparisons (t tests) of the children in the present study and children lost by attrition revealed no differences in any of the variables in the analyses.

Demographic data were collected at pre-test. Implementation fidelity (i.e., whether key components were delivered as prescribed), dosage (i.e., the amount of intervention administered to pupils), and teacher support and commitment to the program were assessed through weekly ratings of implementation quality by the researcher, with the results showing a high degree of fidelity, a very high degree of dosage, and a good level of teacher support and commitment to the program. Post-test evaluation included qualitative data from the teacher's perception of promoted competencies and psychological adjustment, the teacher's and pupil's satisfaction with the program, and national examination grades in Portuguese and math. We expected that the impact would be first (year 2) seen in proximal social–emotional competencies and psychological adjustment, and later (year 3) in distal academic performance (Linares et al., 2005). These results will be reported elsewhere, but are mentioned here to provide a fuller picture. Participants in the present study will continue to be monitored during their transition from elementary to middle school, up to the end of their first middle-school year.

Measures
Variables were analyzed through self-report (students) and hetero-report (teachers) questionnaires before and after program implementation. Two scales were used to evaluate social–emotional competencies (emotional knowledge and social competence), and one scale and two subscales were used to evaluate psychological adjustment (anxiety, aggressiveness, and social problems). Program satisfaction was also measured. All scales, except program satisfaction, were used in previous studies and were demonstrated to have acceptable to good reliability and validity in Portuguese samples. Higher scores on scales reflected higher levels of social–emotional competencies and program satisfaction and lower levels of psychological adjustment.

Emotional Knowledge
Emotional knowledge was assessed through the Assessment of Children's Emotions Scales (ACES; Schultz, Izard, & Bear, 2004; Portuguese adaptation by Alves, Cruz, Duarte, & Martins, 2008). This scale evaluates children's emotion perception accuracy (EPA) and includes subscales concerning social behaviors (15 items; e.g., Jeff is being nice to everybody), social situations (15 items; e.g., Mary's grandfather died), and facial expressions (20 photographs in the Portuguese adaptation). In response to each item, children label the protagonist's feeling by choosing from among happy, sad, mad, scared, or no feeling. This is a measure of maximal behavior because it requires respondents to complete a task that actually taps emotional knowledge. The EPA score reflected how often a child answered correctly to the 40 items for joy, sadness, anger, and fear across the three sections (Cronbach's αpre-test = .58, αpost-test = .56). The “no feeling” items were not included in the EPA score.

Social Competence
Social competence was evaluated by teachers through scale A of the School Social Behavior Scales (SSBS-2; Merrell, 2002; Portuguese adaptation by Raimundo et al., 2012), which includes 32 items (Cronbach's αpre-test = .98, αpost-test = .98) that describe adaptive or positive behaviors that are likely to lead to positive personal and social outcomes. This scale is divided into three subscales. The Self-Management/Compliance subscale (10 items; Cronbach's αpre-test = .94, αpost-test = .94) measures social skills related to self-restraint, cooperation, and compliance with the demands of school rules and expectations (e.g., shows self-control). The Peer Relations subscale (14 items; Cronbach's αpre-test = .96, αpost-test = .96) measures social skills or characteristics that are important in establishing positive relationships with and gaining social acceptance from peers (e.g., interacts with a wide variety of peers). The Academic Behavior subscale includes eight items (Cronbach's αpre-test = .95, αpost-test = .95) that relate to competent performance and engagement in academic tasks (e.g., completes school assignments on time). All the items were rated using a 5-point scale (1 = never to 5 = frequently).

Anxiety
The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAI-C; Spielberger, Edwards, Lushene, Montuori, & Platzek, 1973; Portuguese adaptation by Matias et al., 2006) assessed the intensity of trait anxiety cognitions and symptoms by using only the second half of the full STAI-C measure (20 items; Cronbach's αpre-test = .73, αpost-test = .76). Items (e.g., it is difficult for me to face my problems) were scored by pupils, using a 3-point scale (1 = very little of the time to 3 = a lot of the time).

Aggressiveness
Aggressiveness was evaluated by teachers through a six-item scale (Aggressive Behaviors Questionnaire, Raimundo & Marques-Pinto, 2007), which assesses the frequency of direct and indirect forms of aggressive behaviors (Cronbach's αpre-test = .90, αpost-test = .92). Items (e.g., provokes or threats peers) were rated using a 5-point scale (1 = never to 5 = frequently).

Social Problems
The 10-item social problems subscale of the Teachers Report Form (TRF; Achenbach, 1991; Portuguese adaptation by Fonseca, Simões, Rebelo, Ferreira, & Cardoso, 1995) assessed social, behavioral, and emotional externalizing problems (e.g., doesn't get along with other kids) on a 3-point scale (0 = not true to 2 = frequently true), filled out by teachers (Cronbach's αpre-test = .85, αpost-test = .90).

Program Satisfaction
Program satisfaction was evaluated through a three-item (e.g., did you like the program Slowly but Steadily?) self-report questionnaire (Cronbach's α = .77) for pupils and a three-item (e.g., would you like to participate again in this program?) self-report questionnaire (Cronbach's α = .64) for teachers. Items were scored by pupils and teachers using a 5-point scale (1 = not at all to 5 = very much).

Statistical Analysis
Sampling constraints did not seriously counter-indicate the use of parametric statistical analysis. T tests were used for single comparisons regarding program satisfaction, two-way mixed repeated measures analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were used to explore interactions between pre–post gains and group conditions, and one-way ANCOVAs were used to test group main effects. Intervention effects are reported first, followed by findings of more general developmental change (i.e., main effects for time), because the main purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of the program. A two-way mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to explore interactions between pre-test quartiles and pre–post gains in the intervention groups, and a three-way mixed ANCOVA was used to investigate interactions among pre–post gains, group conditions, gender, and SES. These analyses were followed, whenever relevant, by suitable conservative post-hoc tests. For single comparisons, effect sizes (ES) were calculated using Cohen's d (standardized difference between two means), and for multiple comparisons, ES was derived from ANOVA and ANCOVA as partial eta-squared (ηp2). Cohen (1988) suggests that eta-squared values of .01, .06, and .14 should be interpreted as small, medium, and large effects, respectively; most effect sizes in the social sciences, he reported, were between .01 and .09.

Results
No differences were found, t(1, 316) = .959, p = .338), between intervention (M = 4.50, SD = .67) and control groups (M = 4.43, SD = .72) in terms of program satisfaction, with both showing a strong acceptance by pupils. Similar results, t(1, 12) = 1.994, p = .069) were obtained for intervention teachers (M = 4.39, SD = .36) and control teachers (M = 3.78, SD = .84).

Effects on Social–Emotional Competencies and Psychological Adjustment
Gain differences in all the variables studied were analyzed separately and are summarized in Table 2. A two-way mixed ANCOVA, with “group” (intervention vs. control) as a between-subjects factor, “time” (pre-test vs. post-test) as a within-subjects factor, and gender and SES as covariates, showed a significant interaction effect, with a significant advantage for the intervention group in peer relations and social competence. The effects encountered were small to moderate.

There were also main time effects; both groups increased emotional knowledge, F(1, 293) = 6.709, p < .01, ηp2 = .03, and academic behavior, F(1, 253) = 6.562, p < .05, ηp2 = .03. Group main effects were also founded on peer relations, F(1, 252) = 21.284, p < .001, ηp2 = .08, and on social competence, F(1, 253) = 17.870, p < .001, ηp2 = .07.

ANCOVAs (pre-test mean rating, gender, and SES entered as covariates) were then performed to interpret group main effects. Results indicated that the interaction effect on peer relations, F(4, 251) = 4.928, p < .05, ηp2 = .02, was also due to the program's intervention, whereas in the social competence, F(4, 252) = .521, p = .471, differences were mainly due to group differences in the pre-test.

Interaction effects were only significant for peer relations, after controlling for group main effects.

Effects of Pupil Pre-Test Competencies and Adjustment
To analyze whether there were differences in post-test mean ratings, depending on the mean ratings obtained in the pre-test, a mixed 2 × 2 × 4 ANCOVA was conducted (within-subjects Time, between-subjects Group and quartile Group; Gender and SES as covariates). Interaction effects are summarized in Table 3.

When both the intervention and the control groups were split into quartiles according to pre-test mean ratings, some significant pre-post × Group × quartile interaction occurred for self-management and peer relations. This suggests that some quartile Groups benefited from the intervention more than others only in these two variables. Intervention gains in social competence were irrespective of pre-test quartiles. There were no other gains, per quartile, in the remaining variables. Intervention was efficient in preventing the decrease in self-management in the middle-high quartile and in improving peer relations in the middle-low and middle-high quartiles. For the intervention group, post hoc analyses revealed that the lowest quartile and the middle-high quartile showed an increase in self-management, and all the quartiles, except the highest one, also showed an increase in peer relations. There were no significant differences for the control group.

Effects of Pupil Gender and SES
Social–emotional competencies and psychological adjustment were analyzed by gender and SES. A three-way mixed 2 × 2 × 2 ANCOVA on each variable Time (pre-test vs. post-test) × Gender (male vs. female) × Group (intervention vs. control) and SES as a covariate showed significant differences per gender in self-management, aggressiveness, and social problems (Table 4).

Boys in the intervention group had higher gains in self-management, aggressiveness, and social problems than boys in the control group. There were no differences in girls’ gains between both groups. Because there were gender differences regarding these variables, a two-way mixed ANCOVA (between-subjects Group, within-subjects Time, SES as covariate) was performed for boys only. These analyses indicated a significant interaction effect with a significant advantage for boys from the intervention group in self-management, F(1, 134) = 8.664, p < .01, ηp2 = .06, and social problems, F(1, 133) = 4.748, p < .05, ηp2 = .03, with a more modest advantage in aggressiveness, F(1, 134) = 3.542, p < .10, ηp2 < .03. The effects encountered were all low-to-moderate. A main group effect was based on social problems, F(1, 133) = 14.170, p < .001, ηp2 = .10; an ANCOVA (pre-test mean rating entered as the covariate) indicating that the interaction effect (Group: F(3, 132) = 1.056, p = .306, ηp2 = .008; Covariate: F(3, 132) = 68.504, p < .001, ηp2 = .34) was mainly due to group differences in the pre-test. The interaction effects revealed that boys from the intervention group improved more in self-management and aggressiveness than controls, even after controlling for group main effects and SES, unlike girls, who did not show interaction effects.

In addition, a three-way mixed 2 × 5 × 2 ANCOVA in each variable Time (pre-test vs. post-test) × SES (high vs. middle high vs. middle vs. middle low vs. low) × Group (intervention vs. control) and SES as covariate showed no significant differences by SES.

Discussion
The findings provide some preliminary support for the Slowly but Steadily program, suggesting that the deliverance of this universal SEL program, during one academic year, partially improves the social–emotional competencies and psychological adjustment of fourth-grade children. The results also allow us to pinpoint that gender, but not SES, seems to be a moderator of how much a child will profit from this program. How far a child is from acquiring appropriate social–emotional competencies and being psychologically well adjusted (baseline levels) emerged as a moderator of only two social–emotional competencies.

First, the average pupil who participated in this SEL program improved in peer relations and social competence compared with an average peer who did not take part in such a program. Furthermore, boys who participated in the program presented better self-management and lower levels of aggressiveness than their male peers who did not participate. Also, there were no negative unexpected effects. The program seemed to have an impact on behavioral problems (in boys), such as aggressiveness and social problems, but not on anxiety. These results are similar to other studies of universal approaches in schools, which had less effect on aggressive and disruptive behavior (Wilson & Lipsey, 2007), and on anxiety (Neil & Christensen, 2007) than targeted interventions (CPPRG, 2011; Diekstra, 2008). Maybe this occurred because the base rate of problem behaviors in general education settings is already low to begin with, making reductions to their scores unlikely (Merrell, 2010).

Altogether, these findings are consistent with the only meta-analytic study focusing exclusively on universal school-based SEL programs done so far, which shows significant effects of SEL programs on behavioral outcomes (Durlak et al., 2011). Even with the improvement of only some competencies and with small-to-moderate effect sizes, collectively, our results are in line with the findings reported in studies from other countries, partially supporting the cross-cultural generalization of the SEL programs’ efficacy (CPPRG, 2010; Diekstra, 2008; Durlak et al., 2011). These results are however less impressive than those from other studies, maybe because the intervention was of relatively low intensity and administered over the course of a single academic year.

Second, our results did not support Hypothesis 2. The lack of greater effects on the reduction of aggressiveness and anxiety among those pupils showing the highest pre-test levels was surprising, given findings from other studies regarding the moderating effect of the baseline levels of aggressiveness (CPPRG, 2010) and self-reported symptoms of anxiety (Challen et al., 2010).

Third, gains were irrespective of pre-test levels, except for two variables. The program particularly benefited the children who were in the middle quartiles of self-management and peer relations. To especially benefit children who were most in need, it would be necessary to implement an integrated provision of universal interventions (all children) and selective interventions (children at some risk) into a comprehensive (multicomponent) model sustained across development (CPPRG, 2011) that involved the child, school, family, and community (CPPRG, 2010; Domitrovich et al., 2010), to maximize impact (Domitrovich et al., 2010) by providing an additive effect (CPPRG, 2010), in an efficient way (Bradshaw, Zmuda, Kellam, & Ialongo, 2009). Furthermore, although pupils with above-average social–emotional competencies at pre-test did not improve them directly through the program, they may also have benefited from it indirectly, as they are now dealing with classmates who enhanced some of their social–emotional competencies and reduced some of their previous externalizing problems (Merrell, Juskelis, Tran, & Buchanan, 2008). Also, the program may have had an indirect impact on children's perceptions of their classroom (Brock, Nishida, Chiong, Grimm, & Rimm-Kaufman, 2008), or it may have enhanced the teachers’ perceptions about their pupils (Rimm-Kaufman & Chiu, 2007).

Fourth, the data showed that gender moderated the effect of the program. The intervention effect was present for boys in self-management, aggressiveness, and social problems, but not for girls. However, boys had higher mean levels of aggressiveness and lower mean levels of self-management than did girls. The fact that universal interventions have less effect on internalizing problems (Diekstra, 2008) and that boys are at greater risk for displaying externalizing problems (Dodge, Coie, & Lynam, 2006; Ialongo et al., 1999) may perhaps be why boys also benefited more from the program. Our results are in line with the findings of the moderating effect of gender on the impact of the Fast Track PATHS SEL curriculum on aggressiveness (CPPRG, 2010).

Fifth, the study results supported that “low SES” children profit from the program as much as “high SES” children, but not more, in keeping with what some researchers found in studies on other universal preventive school-based programs and their effects on aggressive behavior (Hahn et al., 2007; Wilson & Lipsey, 2007). Our results are similar to the findings of the Responsive Classroom Approach SEL program study (Rimm-Kaufman & Chiu, 2007), which did not find differences (social competencies) for children from at-risk, and not-at-risk backgrounds, but contradict the results of both, the Fast Track PATHS curriculum study, in which intervention effect for social competence was weaker in low-income schools (CPPRG, 2010), and the UK Resilience Programme study, in which the intervention effect for anxiety was greater for the more disadvantaged pupils (Challen et al., 2010).

Slowly but Steadily was largely based on the primary components of SEL programs and followed CASEL recommendations, especially regarding SAFE practices (Durlak et al., 2011) and the careful monitoring of program deliverance. One strength of the study was that the control group also had a program during the same period that did not include the teaching of explicit SEL competencies to counter potential placebo effects (Greenberg, 2010). To our knowledge, this is the first time that such a methodology was used in SEL programs. Both programs were implemented by the same school psychologist, so we reduced the probability of increased program effects due to the implementer characteristics and the way he or she interacted with children than to the program's theoretical framework and goals. Nor were they due to differences in program satisfaction for pupils and teachers because there were none. Furthermore, Slowly but Steadily has social validity, by being highly accepted by pupils and teachers, who saw it as something that makes sense and meets their needs.

Another strength of the study was that the intervention impact was assessed using data from multiple reporters (the participants themselves and teachers) and methods (self-reports, knowledge assessment, and behavior ratings), which contribute to reducing common method and source biases (Caprara, Barbaranelli, Pastorelli, Bandura, & Zimbardo, 2000; Denham et al., 2009). Especially noteworthy was the use of a measure of maximal behavior, which actually taped the emotional knowledge construct to reduce bias and social desirability (Humphrey, Kalambouka et al., 2010). Teachers who collected ratings did not deliver the intervention, which lends credibility to the findings because it reduced the probability of an expectancy effect (Linares et al., 2005), which poses a threat to internal validity (Rimm-Kaufman & Chiu, 2007).

Limitations
However, these results should not be overinterpreted or accepted uncritically. First, our study was quasi-experimental because sampling was not entirely random. Randomized control trials are not always feasible or practical in the school system, and insisting on them to evaluate complex social interventions can often obscure the effect of an intervention (Catalano et al., 2002; Hahn et al., 2007) and affect external validity. Second, the program was implemented only over the course of one school year. It was not possible to implement booster sessions in the fifth grade, as there was a reorganization of classes when children moved forward to middle school, with an unavoidable contamination of the control subjects. Third, stronger attempts should be made in the future to promote generalization by means of daily activities carried out by teachers. Fourth, although teacher ratings are generally viewed as one of the best methods for evaluating pupils’ social behavior (Merrell, Buchanan, & Tran, 2006), it is possible that teachers’ knowledge of the experimental condition may have influenced results, especially considering the high social validity of the program (CPPRG, 2010). Fifth, because there is no standardized approach to measuring social and emotional skills (Durlak et al., 2011; Merrell, 2010), maybe these skills were not measured as accurately as they should be. Finally, despite the attempt to control for schools, it is possible that differences between experimental and control classes may have been influenced by systematic background teacher, class, or school effects, that is, individual and organizational factors that were not measured (Durlak et al., 2011; Greenberg et al., 1995; Ransford, Greenberg, Domitrovich, Small, & Jacobson, 2009).

Future Studies
A multiyear intervention program for all elementary school years, based on a whole-school approach and including standardized training for teachers and ongoing technical support to facilitate the implementation and dissemination of the program, should be considered in future interventions, as well as encouragement of the proactive involvement of parents and the community (Cooke et al., 2007; Domitrovich, Cortes, & Greenberg, 2007; Merrell & Gueldner, 2010). Future studies should also prioritize randomized control trials (with the unit being the school instead of the classroom or individual) using larger samples, including suburban and rural school systems (Brown et al., 2010; Durlak et al., 2011) and increasing the number of classrooms and schools in each condition (intervention and control) to provide sufficient statistical power to use a multilevel model and enable assertions about the effectiveness of the program (Rimm-Kaufman & Chiu, 2007). Other recommendations are including observations of the pupils in their natural environment (Cooke et al., 2007), parental report (triangulated assessment), and pre-test information about academic achievement in the assessment battery; applying a cost–benefit model to determine the fiscal impact of implementing the program (Bradshaw et al, 2009; Durlak et al., 2011); and addressing other moderators of intervention outcomes, such as child, family, or community risk factors (Bradshaw et al., 2009) and child interactions with the environment (Domitrovich et al., 2007).

A stronger focus might also be needed in adapting the program to ensure that girls benefit more from it (Bradshaw et al., 2009). The impact on not only behavioral but also academic outcomes should be considered. Another important issue is the duration of gains found in this study. We recommend follow-up assessments to find out whether these effects remain statistically significant, as well as analyzing the existence of any possible “sleeper effects.”

Managing one's emotions and relating to others are among the greatest challenges that individuals face in life (Lopes & Salovey, 2004). Universal social–emotional curricula may not be intensive enough on their own to reach this goal, but they represent a step forward (Domitrovich et al., 2007). The present study adds one more element to this emerging mosaic and demonstrates that there are no simple formulae to be applied to all children and circumstances.
