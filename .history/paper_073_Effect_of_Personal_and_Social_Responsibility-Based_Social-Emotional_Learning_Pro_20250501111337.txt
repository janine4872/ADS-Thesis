This article, informed by framing theory, uses qualitative content analysis to analyse the Economic
Freedom Fighters’ (EFF) discourses on race and social inequalities through social media and live
parliamentary debates in South Africa. The article reveals that protest and provocative political
statements by EFF members attract audience and media attention, and reinforce their political
agenda. Political personalities communicate their message effectively on social media and influence
audiences’ perception through protestation. The well-known framing theory by the traditional
mass media has been exceeded by that of social media where politicians radically engage their
audiences. This paper reveals that the populist political style has much impact on social media,
where political actors interact directly with audiences.
