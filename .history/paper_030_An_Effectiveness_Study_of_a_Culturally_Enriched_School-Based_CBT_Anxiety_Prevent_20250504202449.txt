Abstract
Anxiety disorders are prevalent in the school-aged population and are present across cultural groups. Scant research exists on culturally relevant prevention and intervention programs for mental health problems in the Aboriginal populations. An established cognitive behavioral program, FRIENDS for Life, was enriched to include content that was culturally relevant to Aboriginal students. Students (N = 533), including 192 students of Aboriginal background, participated in the cluster randomized control study. Data were collected three times over 1 year. A series of multilevel models were conducted to examine the effect of the culturally enriched FRIENDS program on anxiety. These analyses revealed that the FRIENDS program did not effectively reduce anxiety for the total sample or for Aboriginal children specifically. However, all students, regardless of intervention condition, Aboriginal status, or gender, reported a consistent decrease in feelings of anxiety over the 6-month study period.

Anxiety disorders are present across cultures and ethnic groups (Cooley & Boyce, Citation2004; Costello, Farmer, Angold, Burns, & Erkanli, 1997), and they are the most common mental health problem among children and adolescents, with a lifetime prevalence estimated to be more than 25% (Kessler et al., Citation2005; Merikangas et al., Citation2010). Although some level of anxiety is developmentally normative in school-age children and even adaptive (e.g., serving to increase vigilance to protect against threats and to optimize performance), anxiety is considered to be clinically significant when it becomes excessive, interfering with daily functioning and inhibiting healthy development.

Considerable evidence suggests that anxiety disorders can be effectively ameliorated using brief cognitive-behavioral interventions (e.g., Compton, Burns, Egger, & Robertson, Citation2002; Dadds et al., Citation1999; In-Albon & Schneider, Citation2006). Unfortunately, most children with mental health problems do not receive help (Hoagwood & Johnson, Citation2003; World Health Organization, Citation2004). Children and adolescents with internalizing symptoms receive less clinical attention compared to their peers with externalizing symptoms. This oversight has significant implications given that anxiety disorders often onset in childhood; are prevalent; are chronic and recurrent in course; and yield high cost at the individual, familial, and societal level (Kendall, Safford, Flannery-Schroeder, & Webb, Citation2004).

School children with anxiety disorders demonstrate deficiencies in learning achievement and have reduced access to learning (Beidel, Turner, & Morris, Citation2000; March & Albano, Citation1998). Other long-term consequences include higher rates of tobacco, alcohol, and drug use; secondary school dropout and unemployment; and increased risk for depression, suicide, and other high-risk behavior (Ost & Treffers, Citation2001; Sareen et al., Citation2005). Comorbidity among the anxiety disorders is high, as well as between anxiety and depression (Bittner et al., Citation2007; Compton et al., Citation2002; Kendall, Kortlander, Chansky, & Brady, Citation1992). Anxiety disorders have been found to predate other psychopathology including eating disorders and substance disorders (Sareen et al., Citation2005). Significant evidence suggests a strong continuity between childhood anxiety and anxiety disorders in adulthood (Ost & Treffers, Citation2001).

ABORIGINAL CHILDREN AND YOUTH
According to the most recent census, Canada's Aboriginal (First Nations, North American Indian, Métis, and Inuit) population of approximately 1.2 million represents almost 3% of the total population and more than 6% of the total child and adolescent population in Canada (Statistics Canada, Citation2008). The population is youthful, with children younger than age 24 composing almost half (48%), compared to 31% among non-Aboriginals. The size of Canada's Aboriginal population is second only to New Zealand and is rapidly increasing at a rate nearly six times that of the non-Aboriginal population. Although there are considerable commonalities among Aboriginal peoples, the community is diverse, with 615 First Nations and more than 50 languages.

Research has found that individuals who are in the ethnic minority may not seek therapy in proportion to their numbers, even though they are as susceptible to mental health problems as the ethnic majority (Bernal & Scharron-Del-Rio, Citation2001). This is due to both hesitations on the clients’ part and inadequate multicultural competencies on the therapists’ part (Bernal & Scharron-Del-Rio, Citation2001). In addition, Aboriginal views of mental health differ from the ethnic majority in Canada. In contrast to western notions of health and well-being that focus on the individual, Aboriginal view of health is relational and holistic. Emphasis is on harmony and interdependence between people, the environment, and the spiritual world, and within the individual between body, mind (intellect and emotion), and spirit. Poor mental health indicates a lack of balance of these aspects and is strongly impacted by social structures (Waldram, Citation2004). There is evidence to suggest that the dominant mental health problems in Aboriginal communities and among Aboriginal people are social in nature, rooted in the profound impact of colonization and the intergenerational effects of trauma and loss resulting from the long history of oppression and dislocation (Government of Canada, Citation1996; Waldram, Citation2004).

Although evidence indicates that anxiety is universally present across cultures and ethnic groups (Costello et al., Citation1997; Waldram, Citation2004), epidemiological studies that refer specifically to anxiety or even to the mental health of American Indians or Canadian Aboriginals are few (see Alcántara & Gone, Citation2007; Beals et al., Citation1997; Costello et al., Citation1997, Kirmayer, Brass, & Tait, Citation2000; Manson, Bechtold, Novins, & Beals, Citation1997). In addition, Aboriginal young people are vastly underrepresented in extant efficacy and effectiveness studies. This is particularly troubling given the well-documented problems plaguing Aboriginal youth, including high rates of suicide, alcohol and substance abuse, school dropout, unemployment, and experiences of discrimination and victimization (Costello et al., Citation1997; Kirmayer et al., Citation2000; Manson et al., Citation1997; Waldram, Citation2004). Further, the legacy of colonization has generated significant and chronic anxiety-provoking stressors such as socioeconomic disadvantage, cultural discontinuity, geographic displacement, racism, disease and disability, and lack of family and social cohesion (Kirmayer et al., Citation2000; Waldram, Citation2004).

With low rates of mental health service utilization and substantial barriers to obtaining adequate services, it is important to test ways to optimize the healthy development of Aboriginal children and youth. Although all children develop unique identities during adolescent development, special attention must be paid to ethnic minority youth in relationship to the impact of culture, gender, and minority status (Hansen, Zamboanga, & Sedlar, Citation2000). Practitioners and researchers must be mindful that ethnic minorities are a heterogeneous group and avoid making assumptions regarding shared culture, values, and beliefs.

PREVENTION RESEARCH AND SCHOOL SETTINGS
Recent research transporting evidence-based mental health programming into real-world settings such as schools, and to diverse child populations, suggests the important role of prevention and early intervention approaches (see Mrazek & Haggerty, Citation1994) with groups of young people (Barrett, Farrell, Ollendick, & Dadds, Citation2006; Bernstein, Layne, Egan, & Tennison, Citation2005; Durlak, Weissberg, Quintana, & Perez, Citation2004; Mifsud & Rapee, Citation2005). Mounting evidence has shown the promise of these approaches in both promoting emotional health and resilience and reducing incidence of childhood mental disorders.

Two different approaches characterize the prevention literature. The first, universal prevention, aims to improve the lives of children by offering mental health services to an entire population, regardless of risk status (Mrazek & Haggerty, Citation1994). Large-scale or universal implementation research poses many logistical challenges. However, it is attractive for many reasons, including the opportunity to equip all children with important anxiety management skills, reduced stigmatization by avoiding the need to label some children as “at risk,” and ease of recruitment and scheduling. Drawbacks of an universal approach include significant resource impact (e.g., increased costs for materials, impacts to curricular instruction, use of teacher training and skills) by including people who may not benefit from an intervention (for review, see Offord, Kraemer, Kazdin, Jensen, & Harrington, Citation1998). The second approach, indicated (i.e., children demonstrating initial signs or symptoms of a disorder) or targeted (i.e., children at risk of developing a disorder) intervention (Mrazek & Haggerty, Citation1994), is offered in an effort to keep problematic behavior from developing into a disorder and reducing symptom expression. Some of the more compelling benefits of this approach are cost-effectiveness, greater efficiency, and reduced resource use (e.g., personnel). This study specifically used a universal approach by the request of school districts to provide both social-emotional learning and integrated Aboriginal content into other areas of the curriculum for all children in a particular grade.

Currently, there is support to move health promotion and psychological treatment models out of office settings and into the contexts where children function (Durlak et al., Citation2004). Schools offer an ideal and naturalistic setting for anxiety prevention and intervention. Schools provide access to large numbers of children in an environment that plays a critical role in shaping development. Educators and counseling staff have the opportunity to observe and interact with students on a sustained basis across a variety of anxiety-provoking situations, and therefore are in a unique position to help in the identification, referral, and treatment of anxiety problems. A school-based prevention approach is in keeping with Mussell, Cardiff, and White (Citation2004), who placed high priority on implementing ecological community programming and on supporting capacity building among community members (e.g., school leaders) in order to support Aboriginal young people.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may be appropriate for use with culturally diverse populations. The interventions are objective and context based. Further, CBT is based on learning techniques and skills (Hansen et al., Citation2000). One CBT program, Adolescent Coping with Depression Course (Lewinshon, Rohde, Hops, & Clarke, 1990), has shown promise with Haitian American depressed youth (Nicolas, Arntz, Hirsch, & Schmiedigen, Citation2009). This particular intervention was culturally adapted to make the course more meaningful and relevant to a specific ethnic minority while maintaining the fidelity of the core elements and theory of the intervention (Bernal, Jiménez-Chafey, & Domenech Rodriguez, Citation2009; Nicolas et al., Citation2009). Our project was similarly focused on integrating culturally relevant materials into an existing evidence-based program.

The goals of the present study were (a) to enrich culturally the FRIENDS for Life program (Barrett, Citation2004; Barrett, Lowry-Webster, & Turner, Citation2000), an evidence-based curriculum for anxiety, with culturally sensitive Aboriginal content, and (b) to prevent and reduce anxiety symptoms in children by offering the enriched FRIENDS for Life program in public school classroom contexts. It was expected that the cognitive-behavioral, culturally enriched FRIENDS program would be superior to a waitlist control procedure in reducing anxiety symptoms in participating children.

METHOD
Participants and Procedure
The university's Institutional Review Board approved this study. Written parental active consent and child assent were required as was child English language proficiency. Participants were recruited from 20 elementary schools across three school districts in western Canada. Children in Grades 4 through 6 were specifically targeted for inclusion. However, upon request from some rural schools, students in other grades were permitted to participate due to having cross-grade classrooms (grades ranged from 2 to 7). A total of 791 parents were asked to consent to their child's participation and data collection, of which 595 consented (75.2%) (see Figure 1). The research design for this study involved measuring children's anxiety levels across three time points during the school year. Data were collected at pretest (Time 1; December), posttest (Time 2; March), and follow-up (Time 3; June). Of the 595 children with parental consent, 533 successfully completed our anxiety measure at Time 1 (10.4% attrition), 448 completed it at Time 2 (24.7% attrition), and 353 completed it at Time 3 (40.7% attrition). Attrition is a naturally occurring phenomenon in schools due to student absences, students moving schools, and other changes in school schedules. We did not impute missing values in the present study because the proportions of missing over time are large. Thus, we used list-wise deletion instead. Hence, our sample sizes were reduced over time. We conducted missing analyses for each outcome variable and did not find any differences between students remaining in the program and those dropped out. Students from five of the schools did not successfully complete the assessment due to teachers’ conflicts (teachers on leave, teachers unwilling to finish program); thus only the remaining 15 schools are represented in the current sample.

Boys and girls were equally represented in the sample (50.1% girls), with a mean age of 9.77 years (SD = .99). The sample included 192 Aboriginal students (36%). A majority of the sample indicated speaking English in the home (79.5%), and all child participants were fluent English speakers. After data collection at Time 1, the schools were randomly assigned to either the active intervention with enriched FRIENDS (8 schools, n = 269) or to the waitlist control condition (7 schools, n = 264). The students in the waitlist condition received the intervention program following data collection at Time 2, by request of the school districts (i.e., schools requested all students in the study receive the program during the same academic year). Thus, all participating schools/students had received the program by Time 3, thus precluding any “true” follow-up at Time 3 (discussed next).

Intervention–FRIENDS for Life Program
Overview of intervention
FRIENDS for Life (Canadian Edition; Barrett, Citation2004; Barrett et al., Citation2000) is a developmental, linear, classroom-formatted curriculum for children aged 10 to 12 (Grades 4–6). As with other evidence-based cognitive-behavioral (CBT) curricula, FRIENDS is manualized, with a Group Leader's Manual and an accompanying Child Workbook. Through a variety of group and individual activities, the FRIENDS educational component teaches children to identify and understand anxiety signals, physical/bodily symptoms, worried thoughts, and maladaptive behaviors associated with feeling worried or anxious. FRIENDS is an acronym that helps children to recall the coping and problem-solving skills taught during the program. These include F, feeling worried; R, relax and feel good; I, inner thoughts; E, explore plans of action; N, nice work, reward yourself; D, don't forget to practice these new skills; and S, smile, stay cool and calm. Due to school year time constraints, Sessions 9 and 10 (review) were combined into one session. Therefore, the program was implemented over nine weekly sessions during the regular school day. The program was cofacilitated by a trained classroom teacher with a school counsellor, or First Nations School Support Worker.

List of enrichments for aboriginal students
Retaining the core elements of the evidence-based CBT program, FRIENDS for Life (Canadian edition; Barrett, Citation2004), with the help of two Aboriginal school board consultants, we enhanced the program to be more culturally engaging, meaningful, and attractive for Aboriginal students. We followed the model proposed by Bernal, Bonilla, and Bellido (Citation1995; The Ecological Validity and Culturally Sensitive Framework), which focuses on eight culturally sensitive elements: language, person, metaphors, content, concepts, goals, methods, and context. Specifically, we were interested in enhancing the lessons with examples more reflective of Aboriginal culture, in direct alignment with these eight dimensions. Aboriginal peoples are a heterogeneous group and have very unique artifacts and references from nation to nation, so we used only those references that are common to many West Coast nations.

We focused on four major enrichments. First, we encouraged the teachers to read more of the program out loud or use more storytelling. We wrote scripts for the beginning and end of each lesson. We introduced a new character as guide, Rusty the Raven, throughout (part as storyteller, part as model, and part to be more accessible than Australian animals in the original FRIENDS program). We also had stickers of Rusty made, and after each lesson was completed, children were given a sticker as a reward to place in their workbooks. These modifications are reflective of cultural infusion of relevant metaphor, content, and method. Second, we introduced the craft and use of a “medicine” pouch (i.e., culturally relevant concept, method) in which to place productive (green) thoughts or objects to help support progress throughout the lessons. Children crafted the pouches prior to the start of the program, and they were encouraged to use Aboriginal symbols to decorate them. Third, we replaced a support team activity featuring team T-shirts with a “circle of support” that included concentric circles of family, community, culture, and natural and spiritual world as sources of support and provided culturally relevant examples. Fourth, we developed the “FRIENDS Wheel,” modeled after the traditional Medicine wheel. The FRIENDS Wheel includes physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual aspects and focuses on keeping these four aspects in balance to be healthy and happy. All modifications were reviewed by Aboriginal support workers in the initial training to gauge interest in and adoption of materials and to sense proper reflection of Aboriginal culture. Support for the program with enriched materials was unanimous.

Training
Sixty-three adults participated in a 1-day training, developed and delivered by the first author, with separate workshops in each of three municipalities participating. The standardized training included an overview of anxiety disorders and childhood anxiety (prevalence, behavioral indicators, etiology, course, treatment), principles of prevention and early intervention, introduction to the research project (design, roles and responsibilities, data collection and related issues), and a step-by-step guide through the enhanced FRIENDS program with opportunities for practice and emphasis on facilitator skills. The FRIENDS program (Barrett, Citation2004), as offered for purchase, does not require supplemental training, but teacher training literature suggests specific professional development for social emotional programming enhances new program implementation (Cheney, Osher, & Caesar, Citation2002).

During the project planning phase, the Aboriginal consultant noted a high need for training opportunities in the area of child mental health. Consistent with this, the trainees reported a strong need for training in child anxiety and strategies for helping their students. Thus, more adults were trained than delivered the program, as a commitment to helping with professional development in this specific community.

Program adherence and quality of implementation
To assess fidelity to the FRIENDS program, facilitators were asked to audio record two sessions (one early, one later in the program) that were then rated for adherence to the protocol using a Likert-scaled checklist of program objectives and learning (content) and facilitator skills (quality of delivery) by a trained graduate student who was blinded to the study. Overall results with completed tapes (38% of 56 possible sessions from the groups completing the study) indicated that the adherence to intervention content and objectives ranged from 96.4% (Session 3) to 83.3% (Session 6).

Further examination of leader skills based on a self-report leader checklist of treatment integrity revealed that 84.6% of the leaders were rated as “always” prepared for the lesson (scale = 0–4, M = 3.69), and 76.9% “always … introduced material and/or new skills effectively” and “allow[ed] appropriate time for each activity” (scale = 0–4, M = 3.62). Further, “children seemed to be understanding the principles and concepts in the lessons,” with the rater indicating 46% “always,” 38.5% “most of the time” or “often,” and 15.4% “sometimes” (scale = 0–4, M = 3.08). It was also noted that 46.2% of leaders reviewed homework from the previous session, important in consolidating and building on new skills. Homework, a noted hallmark of CBT intervention, is an optional activity in this program.

Outcome Measure
At all three time points in the study, children completed the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC; March, Citation1997). The MASC is a 39-item self-report measure of anxiety symptoms; each item has a 4-point Likert scale response format, ranging 0 (never true about me) to 3 (often true about me). The scale has shown high internal consistency (Cronbach's α = .90), test–retest reliability (r = .88), and convergent validity with the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (r = .633, p < .01; March, Parker, Sullivan, Stallings, & Conners, Citation1997; Reynolds & Richmond, Citation1978). In addition to an overall anxiety score, the MASC measures four subdomains of anxiety: (a) Harm Avoidance (including anxious coping and perfectionism), (b) Physical Symptoms (including tenseness/restlessness and somatic/autonomic symptoms), (c) Separation Anxiety, and (d) Social Anxiety (including humiliation/rejection and public performance fears). Raw scores were converted to standard T scores.

The MASC was chosen for its excellent psychometric properties and its ability to capture clinically relevant anxiety symptoms both at the factor and item level (March, Citation1997). It is worth noting that the MASC was normed on a sample of 2,698 children and adolescents aged 8 to 19 in the United States consisting primarily of White/Caucasian and Black/African American children and included 2.4% Native Americans, and no ethnic differences were found in his sample (March, Citation1997). For our purposes, the MASC was read aloud by a trained graduate research assistant or by the facilitator and was completed by children in their group/classroom setting. An assessment of Cronbach's alpha for MASC scores from the current sample revealed strong internal consistency across all three time points (Cronbach's α = .91, .93, and .92 for Times 1 through 3, respectively).

In our subsequent analyses using MASC scores (discussed next), it was necessary to distinguish between students with elevated anxiety and those with nonelevated anxiety levels. Thus, we chose to use MASC T scores 1 SD above the mean (i.e., >60; MASC T scores of 65 or above indicate clinically significant levels of anxiety; March, Citation1997) to represent elevated anxiety levels; T scores less than or equal to 60 were considered nonelevated.

Data Analysis
To assess the effectiveness of the FRIENDS program in reducing anxiety, a series of multilevel models (also known as hierarchical linear models; Raudenbush & Bryk, Citation2002) were used to evaluate the change in MASC scores over time. The 15 schools participating in the study were randomly assigned to either the active treatment or waitlist conditions. Multilevel modeling was chosen to account for any cohort effects that students may have experienced in a school receiving the enriched CBT program. We conceptualize that individual students’ scores are nested within schools.

The specific analysis we chose was complicated by the fact that the schools in the waitlist condition eventually received the treatment program after data collection at Time 2. This meant that at Time 3, there were no longer any students acting as a true control group. Without a true control group at Time 3, the research design should be considered incomplete. To resolve this incomplete design problem, we split the research design into two phases. Phase 1 is the period between Time 1 and Time 2, where we compared the students who received the active treatment program to those who did not (i.e., those in the waitlist condition). Phase 2 is the period between Time 2 and Time 3, where we compared the students who received the program over the long term (students originally in the active treatment condition) to those who received the program over the short term (students originally in the waitlist condition). Consequently, the analyses for Phase 1 sought to evaluate whether receiving the FRIENDS program effectively reduced anxiety when compared to receiving no treatment at all. The analyses for Phase 2 sought to evaluate whether the FRIENDS program reduced anxiety over a 6-month period (the longer term effect) compared to only a 3-month period (the shorter term effect). Splitting our research design into two phases effectively doubled the number of hypothesis test we conducted, and therefore, increased the Type I error rate. We accounted for this increase in error rate by dividing the traditional significance level by two; thus, for this study α = .05 / 2 = .025.

The outcome variable for the Phase 1 multilevel model was the difference in overall MASC scores between Time 1 and Time 2. Likewise, the outcome variable for the Phase 2 model was the difference in overall MASC scores between Time 2 and Time 3. Thus, these analyses evaluated the change in anxiety over time. We also tested models of change in anxiety for the four MASC composite subscales (i.e., Harm Avoidance, Physical Symptoms, Separation Anxiety, and Social Anxiety). Each subscale model was tested in both phases of the study, thus there were a total of 10 different multilevel models.

To test each of the models within the multilevel framework we followed a two-step procedure. The first step was to evaluate an unconditional model, which includes no predictor variables but contains only an intercept parameter, the between-schools variance component, and the residual variance component. The second step evaluated a conditional model with all of the predictor variables included, as well as the between-schools variance, and the residual variance. For the conditional model, we were interested in whether the variables for treatment condition (0 = active treatment, 1 = waitlist), aboriginal status (0 = Aboriginal, 1 = non-Aboriginal), gender (0 = girl, 1 = boy), initial anxiety level (0 = elevated anxiety, 1 = nonelevated anxiety), and the pair-wise interactions between these variables account for changes in student anxiety over time. Note that the variable for initial anxiety level distinguished between students with elevated anxiety (T scores > 60) and those with nonelevated anxiety (T scores ≤ 60) at Time 1.

The overall fit of the conditional model was compared to the fit of the unconditional model using the −2 Log Likelihood (−2LL) Fit Criteria. The difference in − 2LL between the two models was evaluated against the chi-square distribution with a degree of freedom equal to the difference in the number of parameters between the two models (McCullagh & Nelder, Citation1989). In our case, the critical value for the chi-square test, with α = .025, was (Δdf = 10) = 20.483. A statistically significant chi-square difference test of model fit indicates that changes in student anxiety are adequately explained by the predictor variables in the conditional model. The SPSS software package (version 17.0) was used to conduct all multilevel analyses with full information maximum likelihood estimation.

RESULTS
Descriptive statistics, including means and standard deviations for overall MASC scores, are presented in Table 1. Two general patterns in the results can be seen in this table. First, girls have consistently higher mean MASC scores than boys, whereas the other variables do not show such a pattern. Note that for initial anxiety level, the elevated anxiety group has higher MASC scores than the nonelevated group by design. Second, in general, overall anxiety scores decrease gradually across the three time points.

The results from the unconditional and the conditional multilevel models of change in overall anxiety for Phase 1 are presented in Table 2. The intercept parameter for the unconditional model is the average change in overall anxiety across all students. The unconditional model intercept was statistically significant and negative (−2.82, p < .025), indicating a significant reduction in overall anxiety from Time 1 to Time 2. The between-schools variance parameter was not statistically significant and was small compared to the residual variance parameter. There was very little variability in the change in anxiety across schools.

According to the chi-square difference test for the Phase 1 model of overall anxiety shown in Table 2, the conditional model explained the changes in overall anxiety better than the unconditional model. However, the change in anxiety for the students in the active treatment condition was not significantly different from that of the waitlist condition, nor did the active treatment interact with any of the other variables in the model. Thus, we concluded that receiving the FRIENDS program did not effectively reduce anxiety when compared to receiving no treatment at all. The only significant predictor in this model was initial anxiety level, which indicated that the MASC scores for students with elevated anxiety at Time 1 decreased significantly over time compared to those with nonelevated anxiety. Factors such as aboriginal status and gender did not have a meaningful impact on the change in overall anxiety for Phase 1.

The four Phase 1 models for the MASC subdomains shown in Table 2 revealed similar results to the model of overall anxiety, with the exception of the Phase 1 Social Anxiety model. Three of the subdomain models (i.e., Harm Avoidance, Physical Symptoms, and Separation Anxiety) indicated that anxiety scores significantly decreased only for students with initially elevated anxiety, but scores for the Social Anxiety subdomain did not significantly decrease for these students. None of the Phase 1 models revealed a significant effect of the active treatment condition on change in anxiety, and calculated effect sizes remain very small (Overall Anxiety = 0.008, Harm Avoidance = 0.059, Physical Symptoms = 0.002, Separation = 0.014, and Social Anxiety = 0.020). The effect sizes were calculated by the formula provided by Spybrook, Raudenbush, Congdon, and Martinez (Citation2009): the mean difference of the two groups (the effect of the active treatment condition) divided by the square root of the total of level-1 and level-2 residual variances.

The results from the Phase 2 unconditional and the conditional models are presented in Table 3. The unconditional model intercept was statistically significant and negative (−3.35, p < .025), indicating a significant reduction in overall anxiety from Time 2 to Time 3. In addition, the between-schools variance parameter was not statistically significant, indicating that there was very little variability in Phase 2 change in anxiety across schools.

Table 3 shows the chi-square difference test for the Phase 2 model of overall anxiety was statistically significant, meaning that the conditional model better explained changes in overall anxiety than the unconditional model. This table also shows that students with initially elevated anxiety were the only group who experienced a significant change in overall anxiety from Time 2 to Time 3. The lack of a significant effect of the active treatment, and the lack of interactions between the active treatment and the other variables in the Phase 2 model, suggests that the FRIENDS program did not effectively reduce anxiety over the 6-month period compared to the 3-month period. Similarly calculated effect sizes were also small, ranging from 0.010 to 0.069.

The Phase 2 conditional models for the Harm Avoidance and Social Anxiety subdomains failed to achieve a significant chi-square difference test (see Table 3). Thus the unconditional model is preferred, and the results from the conditional model should be ignored. For these two subdomains, none of the predictor variables had a significant effect on change in anxiety. Of the two Phase 2 subdomain models that achieved a significant chi-square difference test (i.e., Physical Symptoms and Separation Anxiety), only Separation Anxiety indicated a significant decrease for students with initially elevated anxiety. None of the Phase 2 models revealed a significant effect of the active treatment condition on change in anxiety.

DISCUSSION
There is consensus that children suffer from high rates of anxiety disorders, that transporting evidence-based interventions to children in schools specifically targeting anxiety is worthy of attention, and that children can benefit from being taught skills to manage anxiety. Our study built capacity in schools by training and using teachers as program interventionists, used a universal design, and enriched the FRIENDS protocol with Aboriginal content. We randomized the children into intervention or waitlist control groups by school, evaluated intervention integrity, and used a standardized measure with a large sample of students. Despite these strengths, our analysis revealed that anxiety symptom reduction could not be directly attributable to the enriched FRIENDS protocol.

Aboriginal content was infused into the curriculum to appeal and be more meaningful to an important minority of Canadian school children attending public schools. It was hypothesized that if children were more engaged in the curriculum due to higher culturally relevant materials, learning would increase and therefore program effectiveness would be enhanced. Although the participants in our program with initially elevated anxiety reported a decrease in anxiety over time, so did the students who were not in the program. Based on these findings, we can conclude that students who feel initially anxious tend to become more comfortable as the school year progresses. It is important to note that self-report anxiety symptoms declined over the course of one academic year, but it is yet to be determined whether this trend will carry over to the subsequent school year. This study relied exclusively on student self report of anxiety symptoms, despite efforts to include teacher and parent reports. The overall consensus remains that multiple respondents increase the quality of data collected, despite inconsistencies found across raters in the literature (Schniering, Hudson, & Rapee, Citation2000).

It was interesting to note that children of Aboriginal background did not differ from non-Aboriginal children in anxiety levels, in symptom decline, or in positive response to the program. Children in different schools reported similar behavior at all time points in the study, thus increasing our understanding of the consistency of children in large, community samples from diverse backgrounds. Finally, the children with elevated symptoms of anxiety were especially sensitive to separation anxiety symptom reduction, as consistent perhaps with the age of our sample.

Conducting large school-based trials using psychosocial programming involves many unique challenges. The primary challenge associated with our project relates to transporting evidence-based protocols into the public school system with children in the form of a randomized control trial. Struggles included having Aboriginal representation on the research team, working within the schools with attendant issues of scheduling, overwhelming work responsibilities for school personnel (mismatch between interest and workload), having participating adults understand and truly appreciate the value of the research aspects of the project, suspicion of research focusing on Aboriginal peoples, and life events such as crisis situations within participating classrooms that took priority.

School personnel stated that inclusion of Aboriginal content was positive and useful, as implementation of multicultural educational materials are mandated. It is unknown, however, if the cultural enhancements reduced emphasis from core components of the CBT program, or if non-Aboriginal children would have responded differently to a typical curriculum. Due to difficulties with low reporting of program adherence, any conclusions must be treated with caution.

An unusual challenge is that many school districts participate in other research projects and do not have time or interest in managing additional research projects in their schools. If interest was high in participating in research, doing psychosocial research such as anxiety prevention (traditionally nonacademic issues) can often be seen as “taking children away from ‘important’ academics.” Finally, for those districts interested enough to participate in psychosocial research, often it is because they understand the importance of social emotional development in children, which may limit generalized findings as these educators may show more enthusiasm or have higher rates of fidelity in implementing the program.

The age range of our sample was broad, due to multiage groupings in schools. Rural schools are notable for having multiage classrooms, and much of our sample was located in a rural setting. The children at the lower range may not have benefited from the program due to developmental cognitive lags, and those in the upper range may have been emotionally too mature to participate in a program geared to Grades 4 to 6. As most children in these classrooms were not anxious, floor effects on our primary outcome measure of anxiety most probably occurred. We intentionally targeted districts with a high Aboriginal student population and thus implemented our research in distant, rural districts. This distance may have interfered with program adherence as the research team was available by phone or e-mail only. Indeed, although we assessed program adherence to our best ability in a remote community sample (audio recorded, blind raters), the majority of sessions and program facilitators were not evaluated, thus limiting conclusions. Conducting research long distance was, at times, logistically challenging due to concerns about training and teacher follow-up support, supplies, and assessments at three time points over 9 months.

Analyzing data from large-scale intervention programs has its own unique challenges. Multilevel modeling/hierarchical modeling can take into account the relationship of students nested in schools/classrooms. However, to achieve statistical power (e.g., .80), a sufficient sample size at the higher level to be enrolled for second-level analysis requires larger budgets, larger staff, greater use of resources, and other variables that may preclude effectiveness studies in school or other “real-world” settings. For example, using Spybrook et al.'s (Citation2009) “optimal design” software, we would need 23 schools in order to achieve an effect size of .30, with a power of .80, estimating 20 students with consent from each school, for intraclass correlation .01. Most of the intraclass correlations in our study were very small (i.e., less than .01). Thus, the number of schools in our study (15) may not be large enough to detect a treatment effect.

Although March (Citation1997) included a representative sample of Native American children in norming of the MASC, it is unknown whether this instrument is culturally responsive or representative of the study population. Results from the current study did not support previous findings that Aboriginal children self-report higher rates of anxiety. A future research study could compare the enriched program to a credible alternate condition (such as mindfulness or storytelling) and to follow-up over longer term. Recent research in the prevention of anxiety and depression has found a delay in intervention effect (Barrett, Farrell, Ollendick, & Dadds, Citation2006; Dadds et al., Citation1999; Lowry-Webster, Barrett, & Lock, Citation2003). This is important because in prevention programming, we not only want to ameliorate existing symptoms but also want to prevent future symptoms that could emerge particularly during difficult or transition times.

Implications for Research, Policy, and Practice
It is important to recognize that in universal intervention, despite the practical advantages, the cost of providing skills to children who typically are not demonstrating anxiety symptoms may not be financially advantageous. A cost-benefit analysis of large-scale implementation of prevention programs is recommended. However, we feel that schools remain an influential and valuable point of entry for mental health program delivery, despite the seeming lack of significant change in this study. Dissemination of effective programs plagues our discipline; discovering what works for whom, and why, and how delivered, and when, and at what cost remains a conundrum.

Children often suffer from undiagnosed, misdiagnosed, and subclinical symptoms of anxiety, sufficient to interfere with their development. These children often do not receive adequate service, which allows the anxiety to become more entrenched. CBT skills compliment teaching practice, and our society places a high value on educational institutions as places of success. Giving CBT skills of anxiety management to children while infusing lessons with multicultural dimensions may be of benefit to the larger society. As with any skill development program, however, we lobby for linear, sequential anxiety management programming throughout the school years in order to consolidate learning and to be able to capture children at all developmental phases and vulnerabilities.

Finally, Greenberg and colleagues (Citation2001) suggested that it might take time for prevention effects to emerge. Long term follow-up of prevention efforts in schools and communities is recommended and needs to be taken into consideration in future research designs with community samples. Germ prevention efforts (i.e., washing hands) at the turn of the century seemed silly, time consuming, and a leap of faith; prevention efforts for the most common mental health concern of children must overcome some of these same psychological barriers.
