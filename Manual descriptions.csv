Piloting a more intensive 8-week mindfulness program in early- and mid-adolescent school students,"2.2 Design
For schools A and B a cluster- (class based) controlled design was used. For all classes at school A, and for the pair of Year 8 classes at school B, assignment to mindfulness or control was performed using the randomization function in Excel 2010, undertaken by the principal investigator prior to any contact with participating teachers. However, for the Year 10 pair of classes at school B, group allocation was based on timetable availability, thus the overall design is considered quasi-experimental. Primary outcome measures (Fidelity/competence, acceptability and feasibility) were administered once at post-intervention, whereas psychological outcomes were administered on three occasions: 3-weeks pre-intervention, 1-week post-intervention and 4-month follow-up. Home practice measures were administered twice, at 1-week post-intervention and 4-month follow-up.

2.4 Intervention
Mindfulness Training for Teens (Dewulf, 2013) is an 8-week manualized programme developed for adolescents aged 13 to 18, recently translated into English (Dewulf, 2017). Lesson format is closely modelled on adult Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR; Kabat-Zinn, 1990) and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT; Segal et al., 2013), with each weekly session commencing with guided sitting or lying meditations (10-20 minutes) followed by group inquiry (discussion of experiences and facilitator guided interpretation) and interactive presentations on mindfulness concepts.

Classes were delivered in a carpeted room away from normal classrooms to create a different and special atmosphere compared to normal lessons (Bluth et al., 2016), with students seated in a circle with name-tags to improve engagement with the external facilitator. Lesson length in a previous RCT testing this curriculum (Raes et al., 2014) was 100 minutes, which we shortened to 90 minutes to suit school timetables inclusive of a 10-minute mid-lesson break. Key elements to retain in the shorter lessons were discussed with the programme developer prior to commencement. We note that resultant lesson length was still comparably longer than in the .b Mindfulness in Schools curriculum we tested previously (35-60 minutes; Johnson et al., 2016, 2017). Given the extended nature of the meditations and inquiry with a conscript young audience, we added self-care instructions in the first lesson (options to seek help if distressing emotions arose). At the start of each meditation, students were also given the option of tuning out and taking a rest, or raising their hand if they wanted to leave the room with the school counsellor who attended each session together with the class teacher. Due to a number of students with known trauma backgrounds at school A, a discussion and meditation in the final lesson on forgiveness was modified after consultation with the school counsellor, following recent recommendations by Burrows (2017). Students were given a handout each week summarizing the lesson together with instructions for formal and informal home practices, supported by a bundle of 22 meditation audiofiles that they could download. Students were encouraged to undertake this extra practice to maximize brain change but home practice was not assessable. A midweek email was sent to class teachers with an invitation to read this to students to reiterate key points and as a reminder of home practices.

"Evaluation of the Mental Health Benefits
 of Yoga in a Secondary School: A Preliminary
 Randomized Controlled Trial","Methods
Study population
Adolescents in 7 grade 11 and 12 classes in a Massachusetts rural secondary school were
enrolled in the study through a passive consent, opt-out procedure. The school had a 90% white
student body demographic and a 17% low-income population. All students and parents or
guardians were informed that the students would be participating in a yoga study and could be
assigned to either the active intervention or the control condition. There were no exclusion criteria.
The research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Brigham and Women’s
Hospital. Participants were randomly assigned by class to a physical education-classes-as-usual
group (no treatment control; three classes) or to a yoga group (active treatment; four classes).
Intervention
Participants in the yoga intervention attended two to three yoga sessions per week during the 11-
week program during which either 23, 25, 31, or 32 sessions were held (depending upon the class).
Yoga sessions were 30 min (three classes) or 40 min (one class) long and were held either two
times (two classes) or three times (two classes) per week. (For the sake of clarity, a yoga instruction
period will be referred to as a yoga “session”, whereas a “class” refers to the grouping of students).
The yoga program was a modified version of the Yoga Ed program for secondary schools that is
currently being implemented in a number of schools across the United States (http://www.yogaed.
com). This secular program includes simple yoga postures, breathing exercises, visualization, and
games with an emphasis on fun and relaxation and minimizing risk without unduly complex or
physically athletic or demanding techniques. An important component of the program also includes
development and training in the cognitive skills of mindfulness and self-awareness and a yogabased psychological and philosophical attitude. Each of the yoga instructors underwent a formal
Yoga Ed training course had also both undergone a 200-h yoga teacher training program in the
Kripalu yoga style.
82 The Journal of Behavioral Health Services & Research 39:1 January 2012
Typical 30-min Yoga Ed sessions were structured to include a 5-min initial relaxation or “time
in,” a 5-min warm-up, 15 min of yoga poses, and a 5-min closing relaxation (times were extended
for the 40-min sessions). Breathing techniques were incorporated during the initial relaxation and
throughout the sessions. Each of the sessions had a theme or talking point that was discussed by the
instructor during the session including the following: yoga philosophy and methodology (postures,
breathing, relaxation, meditation, awareness), non-violence, mind–body interactions and awareness, body systems, stress management, emotional intelligence, self-talk and critical voice,
contentment, discipline, decision making, values and principles, commitment, and acceptance.
Measures
Study staff administered a battery of self-report questionnaires to all classes in two sittings just
prior to the start of the yoga program in mid-September, 2008, and again shortly after the end of
the yoga program in mid-December. A few subjects (N=6) who missed the mid-December classadministered questionnaire sitting completed their questionnaires 3 weeks later. Yoga session
attendance and spontaneous student comments, responses, and reactions to the yoga were recorded
by the instructors.","Intervention

Counseling in schools. A rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) based intervention--A pilot study,"METHOD
Participants
Our study comprised an experimental and a control group, both consisting
of 11th graders from two different high schools in the same city (Cluj-Napoca,
Romania). The experimental group consisted of 48 participants (24 males, 24
females), aged 17 – 19 (mean age =18.02 years, while the control group consisted
of 24 participants (11 males, 13 females), aged 17 – 19 (mean age =18.14 years),
both groups belonging to urban areas. 

Experimental design and procedure
After the pretest phase (assessment with ABS II), we moved on to the
introductory phase, which meant presenting the students the basics of Rational
Emotive Behavior Therapy and Rational Emotive Behavior Education (rational vs.
irrational thinking styles, the ABC model, activating events, rational vs. irrational
beliefs, emotional or behavioral consequences, functional vs. dysfunctional
negative emotions, etc; for more information on this matter, see Ellis, 1972; Ellis,
1979). After explaining and verifying their understanding of the ABC model and
the REBT foundations, we moved further to the applications, based on several
resources: Vernon’s Emotional Curriculum for Adolescents (Vernon, 1989),
Bedell’s Handbook for Communication (Bedell & Lennox, 1997). The posttest
(assessment with ABS II) has been done 6 months after the intervention.
In fact, the experimental method consisted of a basic experimental design,
with repeated measures. The independent variable was the REBE program, and the
dependent variable was the level of irrationality. The intervention itself consisted
of a 6 months educational program developed in two 1 hour meetings every week.
Before implementing a selective, adapted REBE program, we first assessed all
students’ basic level of irrationality, as defined by REBT. The program was
structured similar to an alternative curriculum, inspired from Vernon’s application
to REBT (Vernon, 1989, 1993, 1997). We called it Rational Emotive Behavior
Education. For a more detailed example, see Appendix 1 and 2.

Broader impacts of an intervention to transform school environments on student behaviour and school functioning: post hoc analyses from the INCLUSIVE cluster randomised controlled trial,"

Methods
Full details of the intervention and trial were reported in our protocol and main trial report.1 7 We conducted a two-arm parallel repeat cross-sectional cluster RCT of the intervention in 40 secondary schools in south-east England. To be included, schools had government inspections rating of ‘requires improvement’ or above and were recruited by the trial team via emails. Our student population consisted of all students: at baseline in 2014 who were at the end of year 7 (11–12 years); who were then in year 9 at interim 24-month follow-up in 2016 and who were in year 10 at final 36-month follow-up in 2017. Some students moved schools, hence the study was repeated cross-sectional since all were included in analyses. Students were surveyed using paper questionnaires in classes under exam conditions by trained fieldworkers blinded to allocation. After baseline surveys, schools were allocated 1:1 to intervention or control by computer-generated random numbers stratified by: single-sex versus mixed-sex school; school-level student free-school-meal eligibility (0%–23%; >23%) indicating poverty and General Certificate of Secondary Education results accounting for student baseline attainment (above/below the median score of 1000 for England).

The intervention involved all staff in intervention schools receiving training to use restorative practice to prevent and address student conflicts. Approximately 5–10 key staff per school were trained in-depth to deliver restorative conferences dealing with more serious incidents. All schools received a manual to guide the convening and running of a school action group comprising at least six staff and six students, led by a member of the school’s senior leadership team. An external facilitator supported action groups in the first two but not the third year of intervention, when they moved to being self-directed. Action groups reviewed anonymised findings from the school’s baseline survey to understand local needs and aimed to coordinate the intervention and revise policies so that these supported the use of restorative practice. Schools were provided with materials to guide delivery of a social and emotional skills curriculum for students in years 8–10 to receive 5–10 hours teaching per year. The curriculum addressed bullying and aggression but not specific to a particular setting such as school or online. Schools in the control group continued with usual practice.

"The effects of conflict resolution education on conflict resolution skills, social competence, and aggression in Turkish elementary school students","
Method
Sample
This study was conducted in two private elementary schools in Mersin, Turkey. One of these schools was attended as training group and the other as control. The sample included 394 students from second through fifth grade, with an age range of 7.5–11 years. The training group consisted of 327 students (173 males and 154 females). The control group consisted of 67 students (38 males and 29 females). Students were from middle or high socioeconomic status backgrounds.

Training program
‘We Can Resolve Our Conflicts’ program was developed by the researchers based on the theories of empathy, anger management, social information processing, social problem solving, social interdependence, and integrative negotiation. In the first part of the training, students were taught a number of essential skills for conflict resolution. Those are: being aware of their own feelings, understanding others’ emotions, empathizing and trying to understand others’ point of view, expressing emotions and demands in nonaggressive ways, active listening, cooperation, and anger management. Then, the students were trained about the nature of conflict, possible responses to conflict, and the consequences of aggressive, submissive, and constructive responses. Finally, students were taught the problem-solving integrative negotiation procedure consisting of six steps; (1) If you are angry, cool off, (2) state what you want and how you feel with the reasons for your wants and feelings, (3) listen carefully and try to understand others’ perspectives, (4) identify the problem, (5) brainstorm to find out solutions together, and (6) choose a solution that satisfies both parties. The program utilized materials interesting for children, such as photos, cartoons, posters, and stories and different didactic techniques, such as pen and paper activities, class discussions, plays, role-plays, and drama.

Procedure
The Scientific and Technical Research Council of Turkey approved this research. Letters introducing the study and the conflict resolution training and requesting permission were sent to parents by the school principals. After obtaining permission to conduct the study from the parents, school principals, and teachers, a pretest assessment was carried out at the beginning of the spring semester. Second, the conflict resolution program was implemented with the training group. The training school received the training twice a week in 40 min sessions over 10 weeks period, whereas control group did not receive this conflict resolution training. Education was delivered by nine psychology third and fourth year students who received training on theoretical and methodological aspects of the conflict and conflict resolution education given by the researchers. Teachers were asked to apply the conflict resolution lessons into everyday classroom problems by prompting, reinforcing, and reminding constructive strategies. After the training, both training and control groups were assessed in terms of their use of conflict resolution strategies, social competence, and aggression.

Audio-guided mindfulness training in schools and its effect on academic attainment: Contributing to theory and practice,"2.4. Procedure
Classrooms from each school were randomized, by grade, into either the Intervention (INT) or Waitlist Control (WLC) conditions. Students in classrooms allocated into the INT condition were exposed to 10 weeks of the MBSR-adapted program during term time. Classrooms allocated to the WLC condition would be exposed to the intervention in the following school term. Student grades in a variety of subjects (see ‘Measures’), along with overall Grade Point Average (GPA), were assessed before the study started (T1) and again 10 weeks later at the end of term, after the study completed (T2). We also assessed fidelity of implementation (see ‘Measures’).
A 60-min training session was held prior to the planned launch at each of the participating schools. All teachers participated in the first 30 min of training, which included a review of general information related to mindfulness and the research protocol. Both INT and WLC classroom teachers were given instructions on how to provide student grade assessments for the study, and were asked to supply this from the term that had just ended (T1), and again at the end of the term after the study had completed (T2). WLC teachers only attended the first 30 min of the training. During the remaining 30 min, the researcher provided instructions for the research protocol for assessing fidelity of implementation. Teachers were also provided with an overview of the MBSR-adapted program and a Teacher's Guide.
The INT classrooms each received a classroom kit, which was on loan for the duration of the study. The kits included the preloaded iPod MP3 player with 90 MBSR-adapted tracks, a docking station with speakers, Teachers’ Guide, parent letter student journaling notebooks, as well as a few classroom tools including a rain stick and glitter ball. The researcher demonstrated how to use the rain stick to reengage students into a mode of mindfulness, as well as how to use the glitter ball to enable pupils to allow strong thoughts and emotions to settle, like the glitter, so that clearer choices can be made.
The INT classrooms participated in the 10-min-per-day audio-guided mindfulness program, from the 90-track series. Each day, the classroom teacher selected and played one track, in sequential order (1–90), using the preloaded MP3 player and speaker system in the classroom. Teachers were encouraged to pick a normal transition time to run the program, for instance, after lunch or recess or in between two intense subjects. During the last 2 min of each 10-min recording for the older students, students were instructed, while still quiet, to take out their journals and write or draw about their experience with the practice that day in order to integrate any insights. This was done specifically to keep the overall time within the 10-min target and substituted group sharing which forms part of the standard MBSR protocol. Teachers were encouraged to participate in the program, along with students, by sitting and listening to the recording each day.

Strengths gym: the impact of a character strengths-based intervention on the life satisfaction and well-being of adolescents,"
Method
Procedure
Two secondary schools in Great Britain agreed to participate and undertook to implement the Strengths Gym program in the curriculum. Individual class teachers administered measures to students during class time. Students were informed that the school was trialing a new program and student materials and that the survey data would be used to assess whether or not the program and materials would form a permanent addition to the curriculum. As implementation and evaluation of the program as part of the curriculum fell under the discretion of the head teachers, parental consent for individual participants was not provided. However, all students were informed that their responses would remain confidential and that completion of the survey was completely voluntary.


The intervention program
The Strengths Gym program was specifically created to test the hypotheses of this preliminary research study. The aim of the program is to encourage students to build their strengths, learn new strengths, and to recognize strengths in others. The included activities for students are called Strengths Builders and Strengths Challenges. For each lesson, there is a definition of the character strength being focused on and two Strengths Builders exercises for students to choose from and a Strengths Challenge as follow-up activity. The course has three levels for implementation in the British school curriculum: Year 7, Year 8, and Year 9. The exercises in each level are unique, but designed to be equivalent and age appropriate.

The first Strengths Builder option in each lesson is consistent at each level. For example, the first Strengths Builder option in the Year 8 booklet is to tell a ‘Strengths in Action Story’ for each strength, whereas the first Strengths Builder option in the Year 9 booklet is to ‘Create your own Strengths in Action Story’ for each strength. The second Strengths Builder options and Strength Challenge exercises provided in each lesson throughout and across the three booklet levels are unique to each strength and designed to encourage students to further develop their use and knowledge of the strength. These Strengths Builder and Strength Challenge exercises are comparable to those suggested by Peterson (Citation2006), but have been adapted and created for adolescents. As noted by Peterson (Citation2006), these types of character strengths interventions have been systematically tested (among adults) and demonstrated to have long-term positive effects on happiness.

Each booklet begins with the title ‘Spotting Your Strengths’. Strengths are defined here as ‘your best qualities’’. Students are asked: ‘Which strengths do you think describe you best?’ and invited to pick five strengths from the list of 24 (VIA) strengths and their descriptions listed on the next three pages. Once they have chosen their five strengths they are asked to write them down in the space provided on p. 1.

"Design, implementation, and evaluation of an emotional education programme in Primary Education","Method
Participants
The centre in which this programme was implemented is located in an urban environment in a central neighbourhood of a city in the southeast of Spain. The sociocultural level of the school population is medium to medium-high and the students’ academic performance is generally satisfactory.

Procedure
The procedure was as follows:

At the beginning of the first quarter of the school calendar, the project was presented to the management team and the faculty of the educational centre.

Each of the participating teachers completed the scale on the emotional competence of their students (Hightower et al., Citation1986).

Based on the results of this preliminary evaluation, an intervention programme to improve emotional competence was elaborated.

During the months of January to May, the teacher-tutors of the experimental group took charge of including the sessions of the programme within the weekly schedule of tutoring activities. The methodology used was playful, active, and participatory, and the duration of the programme was 20 weeks.

In the month of June, after the programme was completed, the teachers completed the post-test evaluation using the evaluation scale of the emotional competence of the students. Similarly, the degree of participant satisfaction with the programme was evaluated through a series of questions posed to both teachers and students.

The teachers completed the teacher satisfaction questionnaire and then provided their students with the student satisfaction questionnaire.

Design and data analysis
This study adopted a pretest-posttest control group design (Cook & Campbell, Citation1979), in which the control group is not equivalent (García Gallego, Citation2001). This type of design is quasi-experimental because the groups are formed naturally, not randomly, which latter characterises an experimental design; that is, in an experimental design, participants would be assigned to the control group and the experimental group in a completely randomized manner. In a design such as the one we have used, we cannot control all the factors that might influence the dependent variables. As we applied a pretest to measure the initial equivalence of the groups, this study has a design with repeated measures of a single factor (the presence of an alternative ‘treatment’).
